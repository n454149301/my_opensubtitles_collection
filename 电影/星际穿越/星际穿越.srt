我父親是個農民
Well, my dad was a farmer.

7
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,620
那時候大家都是農民
Um, like everybody else back then.

8
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,910
當然他最初並非如此
Of course, he didn't start that way.

9
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,130
電腦顯示傾斜角度太大
Computer says you're too tight.

10
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,840
- 不 我能行的  - 正在穿越直道
- Nah, I got this. - Crossing the Straights.

11
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,010
- 正在關閉引擎 Cooper  - 不
- Shutting it down, Cooper. - No!

12
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,930
- 關閉所有引擎  - 不 要加大馬力
- Shutting it all down. -No, I need power up!

13
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,310
爸爸
Dad?

14
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,360
抱歉 Murph 回去睡吧
Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.

15
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,200
- 我以為你是那個幽靈  - 不
- I thought you were the ghost. - No.

16
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,870
世上沒有幽靈 寶貝
There are no such things as ghosts, babe.

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,210
外公說有幽靈的
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

18
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,660
也許那是因為外公
Maybe that's because Grandpa's

19
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,380
自己就快變成幽靈了 回去睡吧
close to being one himself. Back to bed.

20
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,550
你又夢到那次墜機了嗎
Were you dreaming about the crash?

21
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,260
快回去睡覺 Murph
Get your butt back in bed, Murph.

22
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,790
小麥都死光了
The wheat had died.

23
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,960
枯萎病肆虐 我們只能全部燒掉
The blight came and we had to burn it.

24
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,590
只剩下玉米 我們種了幾畝玉米
And we still had corn. We had acres of corn.

25
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,010
還有 漫天的沙塵暴
But, uh, mostly we had dust.

26
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,050
我沒法準確描述 這風沙持續不斷
I guess I can't describe it. It was just constant.

27
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,240
日復一日 塵土飛揚
Just that steady blow of dirt.

28
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,270
我們會用布條
We wore, um, little strips of sheet...

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,150
掩住口鼻
...sometimes over our nose and mouth...

30
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,820
防止吸入過多塵土
...so that we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

31
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,030
佈置餐桌的時候 我們總是把盤子反扣過來放
When we set the table, we always set the plate...

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,120
倒扣過來放 水杯啊 茶杯啊 不管是什麼
...upside-down. Glasses or cups, whatever it was...

33
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,450
都倒扣著放
...upside-down.

34
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,130
快點 Murph 動作快點
Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!

35
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,750
Tom 下午四點 跟我去穀倉學習怎麼用除草劑
Tom, four o'clock today, you and me in the barn, Herbicide Resistance 101.

36
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,420
- 好嗎  - 遵命
- Check? -Yes, sir.

37
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,630
別拿到餐桌上
Not at the table, Murph.

38
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,220
爸爸 你能修好嗎
Dad, can you fix this?

39
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,310
你怎麼把登月艙搞成這樣
What the heck did you do to my lander?

40
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,470
不是我
Wasn't me.

41
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,520
我猜猜 是你的幽靈幹的
Let me guess. It was your ghost?

42
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,020
幽靈把它從書架撞下來了 還總把書弄掉
It knocked it off my shelf. It keeps knocking books off.

43
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,690
根本沒有幽靈 傻瓜
No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.

44
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,980
我查過了 這叫搗蛋鬼
I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.

45
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,400
爸爸 告訴她
Dad, tell her.

46
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,490
好吧 這不是很科學 Murph
Well, it's not very scientific, Murph.

47
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,990
你說過科學就是確定我們未知的事物
You said science was about admitting what we don't know.

48
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,540
沒話說了吧
She's got you there.

49
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,990
嘿 先把我們的東西看好再說
Hey, start looking after our stuff.

50
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,830
Coop
Coop.

51
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,790
好吧 Murph 你想聊科學嗎
All right, Murph, you want to talk science?

52
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,760
不要只告訴我你害怕幽靈
Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.

53
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,010
不 你要更加深入
No, you got to go further.

54
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,520
你需要記錄現象
You got to record the facts,

55
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,340
進行分析 發現其中的原理
analyze, get to the how and the why...

56
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,430
最後得出結論 好嗎
...then present your conclusions. Deal?

57
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,510
- 好的  - 很好
- Deal. - All right.

58
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,520
- 好好上課  - 等等
- Have a good day at school. - Hold up.

59
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,150
今天有家長會 是家長
Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.

60
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,270
不是家長的家長
Not grandparent.

61
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,360
別著急 小子
Slow down, turbo!

62
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,820
- 那不是沙塵暴吧  - 是Nelson在燒他的莊稼
- That's not a dust storm. - Nelson's torching his whole crop.

63
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,370
枯萎病嗎
Blight?

64
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,950
他們說這是最後一撥秋葵了
They're saying it's the last harvest for okra.

65
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,790
再也沒有了
Ever.

66
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,330
他應該跟我們一樣種玉米
He should've planted corn like the rest of us.

67
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,210
對Hanley小姐友善一點 她是單身
Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley. She's single.

68
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,880
這話是什麼意思
What's that supposed to mean?

69
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,180
為人類繁衍做貢獻 是你盡力的時候了 年輕人
Repopulating the earth. Start pulling your weight, young man.

70
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,300
你還是管好自己的事兒吧 老人家
Why don't you start minding your own business, old man?

71
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,270
好了 Murph 掛二檔
All right, Murph, give me second.

72
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,110
好
Uh-huh.

73
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,070
三檔
Third.

74
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,280
- 找檔啊 笨蛋  - 用力
- Find a gear, dumb-ass. - Grind it!

75
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,490
閉嘴 Tom
Shut it, Tom!

76
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,200
- 你幹了什麼 Murph  - 她什麼也沒幹
- What'd you do, Murph? - Ah, she didn't do nothing.

77
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,870
- 車胎爆了而已  - 墨菲定律
- Blew a tire is all. - Murphy's Law.

78
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,040
閉嘴
Shut up!

79
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,960
- 去把備胎拿出來 Tom  - 那個就是備胎
- Grab the spare, Tom. - That is the spare.

80
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,090
去拿補胎工具
Get the patch kit!

81
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,120
我們在這兒怎麼補
How am I supposed to patch it out here?

82
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,590
你自己想辦法
You got to figure it out.

83
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,720
我不可能一直在你身邊幫你的
I'm not always gonna be here to help you.

84
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,900
怎麼了 Murph
What's going on, Murph?

85
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,270
為什麼你和媽媽要用不好的事給我取名
Why did you and Mom name me after something that's bad?

86
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,820
我們沒有
We didn't.

87
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,690
墨菲定律呢
Murphy's Law?

88
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,740
墨菲定律並不是說會有壞事發生
Murphy's Law doesn't mean that something bad will happen.

89
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,290
而是說只要有可能的事 就一定會發生
What it means is whatever can happen will happen.

90
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,000
而這聽起來沒什麼不好
And that sounded just fine with us.

91
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,630
上車
Get in.

92
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,420
上車 我們走
Get in, let's go.

93
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,890
車胎還沒補好呢
What about the flat tire?

94
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,180
太棒了
Yeah.

95
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,930
那是一架印度空軍的無人機
It's an Indian Air Force drone.

96
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,160
太陽能電池夠整個農場用的
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

97
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,780
你來開 Tom
Take the wheel, Tom.

98
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,580
快快快
Go, go, go!

99
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,840
對準那架飛機
Keep that aimed right at it.

100
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,180
開快點 Tom 我們要跟丟了
Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

101
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,890
對準點兒
Right at it.

102
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,430
保持住
Stay on it.

103
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,100
搞定了
Here we go.

104
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,950
真不錯 Tom
Nice one, Tom.

105
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,790
爸爸
Dad?

106
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,960
馬上就好了 不要停 不要停
I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!

107
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,460
爸爸
Dad!

108
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,000
Tom
Tom!

109
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,890
是你讓我一直開的
You told me to keep driving.

110
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,370
有句老話怎麼說來著
Well, I guess that answers the

111
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,180
我讓你開下懸崖你也去啊
old "If I asked you to drive off a cliff" Scenario.

112
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,230
- 我們跟丟了  - 不 沒有
- We lost it. -No, we didn't.

113
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,580
想試試讓它盤旋一圈嗎
Want to give it a whirl?

114
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,960
這樣
This way.

115
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,430
來吧
Go.

116
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,430
讓它在那兒降落 就在水庫岸邊
Let's lay her down right there at the edge of the reservoir.

117
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,440
幹得漂亮
Nicely done.

118
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,310
你估計它飛了多久了
How long you think it's been up there?

119
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,030
德里飛行指揮中心關閉了 跟我們的一樣
Delhi Mission Control went down, same as ours...

120
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,030
十年前
...ten years ago.

121
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,280
所以飛了十年了
So for ten years?

122
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,870
- 它為什麼會飛這麼低呢  - 不知道
- Why did it come down so low? - I don't know.

123
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,960
也許是太陽把它烤傻了 也許它是在找什麼
Maybe the sun cooked its brain or it was looking for something.

124
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,370
- 什麼  - 給我大號的螺絲刀
- What? - Give me a large flatblade.

125
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,460
也許是找什麼信號 我不知道
Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.

126
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,220
你打算拿它怎麼辦
What are you gonna do with it?

127
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,310
我準備讓它來給社會做點貢獻
I'm gonna give it something socially responsible to do...

128
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,520
比如驅動聯合收割機
...like drive a combine.

129
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,600
我們就不能放了它嗎
Can't we just let it go?

130
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,560
它又沒有傷害任何人
It wasn't hurting anybody.

131
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,730
這東西也需要適應時代 Murph
This thing needs to learn how to adapt, Murph...

132
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,530
就像我們一樣
...like the rest of us.

133
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,830
接下來怎麼樣 你們倆一起來嗎
How's this work? You guys come with?

134
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,040
我有課
I've got class.

135
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,830
她嘛 需要等等
This one needs to wait.

136
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,170
- 你幹什麼了  - 你進去他們就會告訴你了
- What did you do? - They'll tell you about it in there.

137
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,500
- 那我會生氣嗎  - 不是生我的氣
- Am I gonna be mad? - Not with me.

138
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,840
- 求你了 儘量別生氣  - 嘿 放鬆
- Just please try not to. - Hey. Relax.

139
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,590
我搞得定
I got this.

140
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,140
你遲到了 Coop
Little late, Coop.

141
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,850
是啊 我的車爆胎了
Yeah, we had a flat.

142
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,560
然後順便到亞洲戰鬥機商店逛了一圈
And I guess you had to stop off at the Asian fighter plane store.

143
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,440
不 其實 那是一架無人偵察機
No, actually, sir, that's a surveillance drone.

144
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,360
太陽能電池性能特別好 是印度的
With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.

145
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,110
請坐吧
Take a seat.

146
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,740
那麼
So, uh...

147
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,030
Tom的成績出來了
...we got Tom's scores back.

148
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,540
他會成為一個非常棒的農民
He's going to make an excellent farmer.

149
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,210
是的 他確實挺有天賦 那大學呢
Yeah, he's got a knack for it. What about college?

150
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,300
大學的錄取名額非常少
The university only takes a handful.

151
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,130
教育資源稀缺
They don't have the resources to--

152
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,590
我一直在交稅
I still pay my taxes.

153
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
那些錢都去哪兒了 現在又沒有軍隊
Where's that money go? There's no more armies.

154
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,590
反正沒有用到大學教育上
Well, it doesn't go to the university.

155
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,800
聽著 Coop 你得現實一點
Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.

156
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,770
你現在就把我兒子拒之大學門外了嗎
You're ruling my son out for college now?

157
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,810
- 他才15歲  - Tom的分數不夠上大學的
- The kid's 15. - Tom's score simply isn't high enough.

158
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,980
你腰圍多少 32嗎
What's your waistline? About what, 32?

159
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,070
- 褲腿33嗎  - 我不知道你什麼意思
- About a 33 inseam? - I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.

160
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,950
需要兩組數位才能
It takes two numbers to measure

161
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,660
測量你的屁股 一次成績就決定我兒子的未來嗎
your ass but only one to measure my son's future?

162
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,410
別這樣 你是受過高等教育的人 Coop
Come on. You're a well-educated man, Coop.

163
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,540
- 一個飛行員  - 還是工程師
- And a trained pilot. - And an engineer.

164
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,790
沒錯 但是現在我們不需要工程師了
Okay, well, right now we don't need more engineers.

165
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,490
我們缺少的不是
We didn't run out of

166
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,590
電視和飛機 我們缺少的是食物
television screens and planes. We ran out of food.

167
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,340
世界需要農民 像你這樣的好農民
The world needs farmers. Good farmers, like you.

168
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,890
- 還有Tom  - 沒受過教育的農民
- And Tom. - Uneducated farmers.

169
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,550
我們是守護地球的一代
We're a caretaker generation,

170
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,730
Coop 情況正在好轉
Coop. And things are getting better.

171
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,900
也許你的孫輩
Maybe your grandkids

172
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,020
- 能成為工程  - 說完了嗎 先生
- will get to be engin-- - Are we done here, sir?

173
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,400
沒有
No.

174
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,400
Hanley小姐還要談談Murph
Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.

175
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,280
Murph是個好孩子 很聰明
Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.

176
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,700
但她最近惹了一些麻煩
But she's been having a little trouble lately.

177
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,710
她把這個帶到學校給同學看
She brought this in to show the students.

178
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,240
關於登月的這章
The section on the lunar landings.

179
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,910
這是我的舊課本
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.

180
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,370
她很喜歡裡面的圖片
She always loved the pictures.

181
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,940
這是舊的聯邦教科書
It's an old federal textbook.

182
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,250
我們已經用修正過的版本替代它了
We've replaced them with the corrected versions.

183
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,460
修正過的
Corrected?

184
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,020
解釋了阿波羅計畫
Explaining how the Apollo

185
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,760
是我們偽造的 目的是迫使蘇聯破產
missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

186
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,430
你不相信我們登過月
You don't believe we went to the moon'?

187
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
我相信這是非常聰明的政治策略
I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda.

188
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,560
讓蘇聯把資源都浪費在
The Soviets bankrupted themselves pouring resources...

189
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,980
火箭和沒用的機器上
...into rockets and other useless machines.

190
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,230
沒用的機器
"Useless machines."

191
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,960
如果我們不想重蹈
If we don't want a repeat of the

192
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,490
二十世紀過度浪費的覆轍 那麼
excess and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

193
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,150
我們就必須教孩子們
...we need to teach our kids

194
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,450
認識這個星球 而不是想著離開它
about this planet, not tales of leaving it.

195
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,520
那些沒用的機器中
One of those useless machines

196
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,290
有一種叫核磁共振儀
they used to make was called an MRI.

197
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,020
哪怕還剩下一台
If we had any of those left,

198
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,000
醫生們就能及時發現
the doctors would've been able to find...

199
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,490
我妻子腦內的囊腫
...the cyst in my wife's brain

200
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,920
而不是在她死後
before she died instead of afterwards.

201
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,170
那麼坐在這裡聽這些話的人就會是她而不是我了
Then she'd have been the one listening to this instead of me...

202
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,430
那樣會更好一點 因為她一直都
...which would have been a good thing, because she was always...

203
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,510
比我冷靜
...the calmer one.

204
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,270
你妻子的事我很抱歉
I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.

205
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,030
但是Murph跟幾個同學
But Murph got into a fistfight

206
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,190
打了起來 就因為這些
with several of her classmates over this...

207
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,020
阿波羅的無稽之談
...Apollo nonsense.

208
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,650
所以我們覺得應該把你找來
So we thought it best to bring you in and see what ideas...

209
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,680
和你溝通一下
...you might have for

210
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,490
看看從家長的方面該如何教育她
dealing with her behavior on the home front.

211
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,740
是啊 知道嗎 明天晚上有一場比賽
Yeah, you know what? Um, there's a game tomorrow night.

212
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,030
她最近特別喜歡棒球
She's going through a bit of a baseball phase.

213
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,020
有她最喜歡的球隊
Her favorite team is playing.

214
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,410
到時候會有糖果 汽水
There's gonna be candy and soda and...

215
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,340
我帶她去看比賽吧
I think I'll take her to that.

216
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,930
談得怎麼樣
How'd it go?

217
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,720
你這幾天不用上學了
I got you suspended.

218
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,470
什麼
What?

219
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,390
我是Cooper 請講
This is Cooper. Go.

220
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,390
Coop 你改裝的聯合收割機出故障了
Coop, those combines you rebuilt went haywire.

221
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,730
重置一下控制器就好了
Just reset the controllers.

222
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,690
我重置了 但你得回來看看
I did that. Now you should come take a look.

223
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,420
它們接二連三地離開田地跑到這兒來
One by one they've been peeling off the fields and heading over.

224
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,420
有什麼東西干擾了指南針
Something's interfering with the compass.

225
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,300
磁場或者什麼
Magnetism or some such.

226
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,890
掉下來的書沒有什麼特別之處
Nothing special about which book.

227
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,810
我一直在研究 像你說的
I've been working on it, like you said.

228
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,060
- 我數了這些空格  - 為什麼
- I counted the spaces. - Why?

229
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,190
如果幽靈想要傳達什麼資訊呢
In CASE the ghost is trying to communicate.

230
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,530
我在試摩爾斯電碼
I'm trying Morse.

231
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,360
摩爾斯電碼
Morse?

232
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,780
是的
Yeah.

233
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,830
- 點和線 用來  - 我知道摩爾斯電碼是什麼 Murph
- Dots and dashes, used-- - I know what Morse code is, Murph.

234
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,910
我只是不認為你的書架想跟你說話
I just don't think your bookshelf's trying to talk to you.

235
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,230
重置了所有指南針
Had to reset every compass

236
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,890
和定位系統才消除異常
clock and GPS to offset for the anomaly.

237
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,720
- 什麼異常  - 我不知道
- Which is? - I don't know.

238
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,640
如果房子建在了金屬礦上
If the house was built on magnetic ore...

239
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,900
第一次開拖拉機的時候我們就會發現的
...we'd have seen this the first time we switched on the tractor.

240
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,730
聽說你在學校的談話不是很順利
I hear your meeting at the school didn't go so well.

241
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,070
你聽說了
You heard?

242
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,870
我們似乎已經迷失自我了 Donald
It's like we've forgotten who we are, Donald.

243
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,040
我們是探索者 是先驅 而不是守護者
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

244
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,370
當我還是個孩子的時候
When I was a kid...

245
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,670
感覺每天都有新的發明
...it felt like they made something new every day. Some...

246
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,340
新的小玩意兒 新的想法 每天都像過聖誕
...gadget or idea. Like every day was Christmas.

247
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,470
但那時有六十億人口
But six billion people...

248
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,890
你想像一下
...just try to imagine that.

249
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,890
每個人都想擁有一切
And every last one of them trying to have it all.

250
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,190
現在這個世界並不算太壞
This world isn't so bad.

251
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,650
Tom會過得很好
And Tom will do just fine.

252
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,680
不屬於這個時代的人是你
You're the one who doesn't belong.

253
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,200
晚生了40年或者早了40年
Born 40 years too late, or 40 years too early.

254
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,700
我女兒懂 上帝保佑她
My daughter knew it, God bless her.

255
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,370
你的孩子也懂 特別是Murph
And your kids know it. Especially Murph.

256
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,130
我們過去常常仰望星空
Well, we used to look up in the sky and wonder...

257
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,670
思考自身的存在
...at our place in the sTARS.

258
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:54,470
而現在我們只能擔心如何在沙塵暴中生存下去
Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.

259
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,800
Cooper 你有你的專長
Cooper, you were good at something...

260
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,640
卻從沒得到機會施展
...and you never got a chance to do anything with it.

261
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,770
我很遺憾
I'm sorry.

262
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,900
沒人預料到
You didn't expect...

263
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,610
這片賜予我們糧食的土地
...this dirt that was giving you this food...

264
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,030
會轉頭攻擊你 毀滅你
...to turn on you like that and destroy you.

265
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,660
我記得那是在四月 四月十五號
In April-- I believe I'm right-- Fifteenth of April, I think.

266
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,410
大約是在一點半的時候
This happened about 1:30 when that thing...

267
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,500
沙塵暴出現在峽谷上
...came off the top of that canyon.

268
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,330
我那時候的球手才是真正的球手
In my day, we had real ballplayers.

269
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,250
這都哪來的笨蛋
Who are these bums?

270
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,130
我那時候 人人都忙著
In my day, people were too busy...

271
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,340
搶食物 誰還會去打棒球啊
...fighting over food to even play baseball.

272
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:37,510
看球賽吃爆米花 太彆扭了 我想吃熱狗
Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural. I want a hot dog.

273
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,810
學校說你會跟隨我的腳步
School says you're gonna follow in my footsteps.

274
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,060
我覺得這很不錯
I think that's great.

275
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,640
- 你覺得這很不錯嗎  - 你討厭種地 爸爸
- You think that's great? - You hate farming, Dad.

276
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,060
外公說的
Grandpa said.

277
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,650
外公這麼說的嗎
Grandpa said, huh?

278
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,610
聽著 關鍵是你自己覺得怎麼樣
Listen, all that matters is how you feel about it.

279
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,440
我喜歡你的職業
I like what you do.

280
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,660
我喜歡我們的農場
I like our farm.

281
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,950
你會幹得非常出色的
You're gonna be great at it.

282
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,300
我們走吧
Let's get out of here.

283
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,560
這沙塵真猛
All right, it's a doozy.

284
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,100
大家都把口罩戴上
All right, gang, let's mask up.

285
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,440
- Tom Murph 好了嗎  - 好了
- Tom? Murph? Check'? - Yeah.

286
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,580
Murph Tom 你們的窗戶都關上了吧
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?

287
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,080
Murph
Murph?

288
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,770
是幽靈
The ghost.

289
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,650
拿上你的枕頭
Grab your pillow.

290
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,280
去跟Tom一起睡
You're sleeping in with Tom.

291
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,880
這不是幽靈
It's not a ghost.

292
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,720
是引力
It's gravity.

293
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,720
我先送Tom上學 然後去鎮上
I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town.

294
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:12,180
你們倆介意收拾一下嗎 等你們禱告完以後
You want to clean that up when you've finished praying to it?

295
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,800
不是摩爾斯電碼 Murph 是二進位
It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.

296
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,260
寬的是1 窄的是0
Thick is one, thin is zero.

297
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,050
是座標
Coordinates.

298
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,140
不是
Nope.

299
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,770
這裡
Here we go.

300
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,730
33
Thirty-three.

301
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,730
就是這兒
That's it.

302
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,700
我也要去
I can't miss this!

303
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,200
外公幾個小時後就會回來 Murph
Grandpa will be back in a couple hours, Murph.

304
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,660
但是你還不知道會發現什麼呢
But you don't know what you're gonna find.

305
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,000
所以
And that...

306
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,170
我就更不能帶你去了
...is why I can't take you.

307
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,380
Murph
Murph?

308
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,120
外公一會兒就回來了
Grandpa will be home in a while.

309
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,970
告訴他我會用無線電給他打電話
Tell him I'll call him on the radio.

310
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,400
- 啊  - 天哪
- Aah! -Jesus.

311
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,310
你在幹嗎
What are you doing?

312
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,610
噢 你覺得這很好玩是嗎
Oh, you think this is funny? Huh?

313
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,280
要不是我你根本不會在這兒
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

314
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,120
那就幫點忙
Make yourself useful.

315
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,800
嘿 Murph
Hey, Murph?

316
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,470
Murphy
Murphy

317
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,310
我想路就到這兒了
I think this is the end of the road.

318
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,360
你不是帶了老虎鉗嗎
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

319
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,780
真是我女兒
That's my girl.

320
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,770
不許靠近柵欄
Step away from the fence!

321
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,020
別開槍 我沒有武器 我女兒在車上
Don't shoot! I'm not armed. My daughter's in the car.

322
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,820
請不要害怕
Don't be afraid.

323
00:24:51,212 --> 00:24:52,562
北美防空聯合司令部

324
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,630
你怎麼找到這個地方的
How did you find this place?

325
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,670
我女兒在哪兒
Where's my daughter?

326
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,450
我有這裡的座標
You had the coordinates for this

327
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,880
標記在你的地圖上 你是從哪兒搞到的
facility marked on your map. Where did you get them?

328
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,380
我女兒呢
Where's my daughter?

329
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,470
別讓我再把你放倒 坐下
Don't make me take you down again. Sit down!

330
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,010
你還覺得你是海軍陸戰隊的嗎 夥計
Oh, you still think you're a Marine, pal?

331
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,770
海軍陸戰隊早就沒了
Marines don't exist anymore.

332
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,720
你這種傢伙挺適合幫我去割草
And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.

333
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,020
你從哪兒得到的座標
Where did you find those coordinates?

334
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,770
不過你看起來不像割草機
But you don't look much like a lawnmower.

335
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,780
我只能大材小用 把你改成吸塵器了
Think I'll turn you into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

336
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,150
不 你不會的
No, you won't.

337
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,700
TARS 下去吧
TARS, back down, please.

338
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,330
你徵用前軍用設備可是要冒很大風險的
You know, you're taking a risk using ex-military security.

339
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,620
太舊了 而且控制單元非常不穩定
They're old, and their control units are unpredictable.

340
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,790
政府就只能提供這些
It's what the government could spare.

341
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,630
你是誰
Who are you?

342
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,420
Brand博士
Dr. Brand.

343
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,970
我認識一位元Brand博士 他是個教授
I knew a Dr. Brand once. He was a professor.

344
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,840
我不像一個教授嗎
What makes you think I'm not?

345
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,640
確實不像 也不可愛
Wasn't near as cute, either.

346
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,480
拜託 Brand博士 我不知道這是什麼情況
Please, Dr. Brand. I don't have any idea what this is.

347
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,810
我很擔心我女兒 只想她能在我身邊
Now I'm scared for my daughter and want her by my side.

348
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,440
你把我女兒帶來 我什麼都告訴你
You give me that, I'll tell you anything you want to know.

349
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,820
把負責人和那個女孩兒帶到會議室
Get the principals and the girl in the conference room, please.

350
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,530
你女兒沒事
Your daughter is fine.

351
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,030
她很聰明
Bright kid.

352
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,450
她媽媽一定也很聰明
Must have a very smart mother.

353
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,040
很明顯你們不想要任何到訪者
It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors.

354
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,360
那為什麼不放我們回到圍欄那裡
So why don't you just let us back up from your fence

355
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,170
我們會自己離開的
and we'll be on our way? Huh?

356
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,000
- 沒這麼簡單  - 就這麼簡單
- It's not that simple. - Well, sure, it is.

357
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,990
我根本不認識你
I don't know anything about you.

358
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,010
對這個地方也一無所知
I don't know anything about this place.

359
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,050
不 你知道
Yes, you do.

360
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,850
爸爸
Dad!

361
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:48,562
拉撒路

362
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,560
你好 Cooper
Hello, Cooper.

363
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,060
Brand教授
Professor Brand.

364
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,190
解釋一下你是怎麼找到這裡的
Explain to me how you found this facility.

365
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,590
是個意外
Kind of an accident.

366
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,660
無意之中發現的 我們在搜集廢棄物品
We sort of stumbled upon it. We were on a salvage run--

367
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,530
你正坐在全世界最隱蔽的地方
You're sitting in the best-kept secret in the world.

368
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,200
沒人能夠意外找到這裡 也沒人能隨便離開
Nobody stumbles in here. Nobody stumbles out.

369
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,210
Cooper 拜託
Cooper, please.

370
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,750
配合一下這些人
Cooperate with these people.

371
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,130
聽著
Look.

372
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,710
這很難解釋
It's kind of hard to explain.

373
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:19,040
我們找到這個座標是因為一個異常現象
We learned these coordinates from an anomaly.

374
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,300
什麼異常現象
What sort of anomaly?

375
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,090
我不想說那是超自然現象
I hesitate to term it supernatural,

376
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,760
但那確實不符合科學規律
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

377
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:27,850
你得說得更具體一點 Cooper先生 就現在
You're going to have to be specific, Mr. Cooper. Right now.

378
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,270
是引力異常
It was gravity.

379
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,150
是什麼樣的引力異常現象 在哪兒
Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly? Where was this?

380
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,610
我很高興你對這個問題這麼感興趣
Now, I'm real happy that you're excited about gravity, but...

381
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,960
但我不會說的
...but you're not getting

382
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,990
除非你們能給我保證
any answers from us until I get assurances.

383
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,450
- 保證  - 是的
- Assurances? - Yeah.

384
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,910
比如 保證我們離開這裡
Like, that we're getting out of here.

385
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,750
而且不是被裝進後備箱那種
And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

386
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,420
你不知道我們是誰嗎 Coop
Don't you know who we are, Coop?

387
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,840
不 教授 我不知道
No, professor, I don't.

388
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,010
你認識我父親 Brand教授
You know my father, Professor Brand.

389
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,920
我們是NASA的
We're NASA.

390
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,920
NASA 美國國家航空航天局

391
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,930
- NASA  - NASA.
- NASA. - NASA.

392
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,060
你效力過的那個NASA
The same NASA you flew for.

393
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,780
我聽說你們部門被關閉了 先生
I heard they shut you down, sir...

394
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,240
因為你們拒絕從平流層往下投炸彈
...for refusing to drop bombs from the stratosphere...

395
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,950
投向挨餓的人們
...onto starving people.

396
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,450
當他們意識到濫殺群眾
When they realized that killing other people was...

397
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,450
並不是長久之計的時候 就把我們又召回來了
...not a long-term solution, then they needed us back.

398
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,620
- 秘密地  - 為什麼要保密
- In secret. - Why secret?

399
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,050
因為公眾
Because public opinion

400
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,630
不允許花錢在宇宙探索上
wouldn't allow spending on space exploration.

401
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,380
尤其是當人們還填不飽肚子的時候
Not while you're struggling to put food on the table.

402
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,960
枯萎病
Blight.

403
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:44,260
七年前殺死了小麥 今年是秋葵
Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.

404
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,680
現在只剩下玉米了
Now there's just corn.

405
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,970
可我們種的比以往還多
And we're growing more than we ever have.

406
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,680
但就像愛爾蘭的
But like the potatoes in

407
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,310
土豆和沙塵暴裡的小麥一樣
Ireland and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

408
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,400
玉米 也會絕跡
...the corn will die.

409
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,190
很快
Soon.

410
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:07,080
我們會找到辦法的 教授 總會有辦法的
We'll find a way, professor. We always have.

411
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,830
就憑地球屬於人類這個堅定的信念嗎
Driven by the unshakable faith the Earth is ours.

412
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,210
地球不單是我們的
Not just ours, no.

413
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,330
但這裡是我們的家
But it is our home.

414
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:21,010
地球的大氣層80%都是氮氣
Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.

415
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,880
可我們不呼吸氮氣
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

416
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,600
但枯萎病菌呼吸氮氣 所以當它越來越猖獗
Blight does. And as it thrives,

417
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,390
空氣裡的氧氣就會越來越少
our air gets less and less oxygen.

418
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,020
經歷過饑餓的這一波人將會面臨窒息
The last people to starve will be the first to suffocate.

419
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,350
你女兒這代人
And your daughter's generation...

420
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,270
將是這個地球上的最後一代
...will be the last to survive on Earth.

421
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,550
Murph有點累了
Murph is feeling a little tired.

422
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,030
能不能讓她在我的辦公室睡一會兒
I was wondering if she could take a nap in my office.

423
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,030
好 謝謝
Yeah. Thank you.

424
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,870
好了
Okay.

425
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,370
現在告訴我 你們拯救世界的計畫是什麼
...now you need to tell me what your plan is to save the world.

426
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,540
我們不是要拯救這個世界 而是要離開它
We're not meant to save the world. We're meant to leave it.

427
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,420
漫遊者
Rangers.

428
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,590
這是在軌道上
The last components of our

429
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,680
一艘多功能船永恆號的最後一個元件
one versatile ship in orbit, the Endurance.

430
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,600
我們最後的遠征
Our final expedition.

431
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:14,350
你派人去外太空尋找新的居住地
You sent people out there looking for a new home?

432
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,270
拉撒路行動
The Lazarus missions.

433
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,270
拉撒路 聖經中的人物 病死後第四日復活 被視為耶穌神跡的表現

434
00:30:15,162 --> 00:30:21,162
拉撒路（Lazarus）
《聖經•約翰福音》中記載的人物
他病危時沒等到耶穌的救治就死了
但耶穌一口斷定他將復活
四天后拉撒路果然從山洞裡走出來
證明了耶穌的神跡

435
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,560
- 哦 聽起來真了不起  - 死而復生的拉撒路
- Oh, that sounds cheerful. - Lazarus came back from the dead.

436
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,900
對 死而復生 那就得先死
Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

437
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,470
太陽系沒有
There's not a planet in

438
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,240
適合人類生存的星球
our solar system that could sustain life...

439
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,910
系外最近的行星卻在一千光年之外
...and the nearest star's over a thousand years away.

440
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,740
這根本是無謂的掙扎
That doesn't even qualify as futile.

441
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,750
你將他們送去哪裡了
Where'd you send them?

442
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,580
Cooper
Cooper...

443
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,540
我只能告訴你這麼多了 除非你同意
...I can't tell you anymore unless you agree...

444
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,540
來駕駛飛船
...to pilot this craft.

445
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,450
你曾經是我們最好的宇航員
You're the best pilot we ever had.

446
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,010
我也就到過平流層
I barely left the stratosphere.

447
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,420
這些人連模擬艙都沒出過
This team never left the simulator.

448
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,200
我們需要宇航員
We need a pilot, and this

449
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,550
你以前的訓練就是為了這個
is the mission that you were trained for.

450
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,220
我訓練的時候可不知道有這麼個計畫
Without even knowing it?

451
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,700
一個小時前
An hour ago, you didn't

452
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,520
你都不知道我還活著 計畫不還在進行中嗎
even know I was alive. You were going anyway.

453
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,400
我們別無選擇
We had no choice.

454
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,310
但你來到了這兒
But something sent you here.

455
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,360
- 他們選擇了你  - 他們是誰
- They chose you. - Who's "They"?

456
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,240
我要去多久
How long would I be gone?

457
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,750
很難說 幾年
Hard to know. Years?

458
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,080
我有孩子 教授
I've got kids, professor.

459
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,630
到太空去 拯救他們
Get out there and save them.

460
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,380
他們是誰
Who's "They"?

461
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,340
我們從五十年前就開始探測到引力異常現象
We started detecting gravitational anomalies almost 50 years ago.

462
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,980
多數是小的畸變
Mostly small distortions

463
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,310
在大氣層上層的儀器中
to our instruments in the upper atmosphere.

464
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,600
事實上 我相信你自己也曾經遇到過
In fact, I believe you encountered one yourself.

465
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,270
是的 在直道上
Yeah, over the Straights.

466
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,320
那次事故 控制系統受到了外力干擾
My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

467
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,690
正是
Exactly.

468
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,450
但在所有的異常現象中 最為顯著的是
But of all these anomalies, the most significant is this:

469
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,620
在土星附近
Out near Saturn...

470
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,870
時空發生了畸變
...A disturbance of space-time.

471
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,130
- 那是蟲洞嗎  - 四十八年前出現的
- Is that a Wormhole? - It appeared 48 years ago.

472
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,500
它通向哪裡
And it leads where?

473
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,670
另一個星系
Another galaxy.

474
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,680
蟲洞不會自然形成
A wormhole's not a naturally occurring phenomenon.

475
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,260
是有人放在那裡的
Someone placed it there.

476
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,550
- 他們嗎  - 嗯
- "They"? - Mm.

477
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:19,140
不論他們是誰 很顯然他們是在幫助我們
And whoever they are, they appear to be looking out for us.

478
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,190
通過蟲洞 我們能前往其他星球
That Wormhole lets us travel to other sTARS.

479
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,270
出現得非常及時
It came along right as we needed it.

480
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,360
他們將宜居的世界 放在了我們觸手可及的地方
They've put potentially habitable worlds right within our reach.

481
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,440
十二個 這是我們初步探查的結果
Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.

482
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,990
- 你們派了探查器嗎  - 嗯
- You sent probes into that? -Mm-hm.

483
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,160
我們是派人去的 十年前
We sent people into it. Ten years ago.

484
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,160
拉撒路行動
The Lazarus missions.

485
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,700
十二個可能的世界
Twelve possible worlds...

486
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,210
十二架漫遊者飛船
...twelve Ranger launches carrying...

487
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,080
載著最勇敢的人
...the bravest humans ever to live...

488
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,880
由了不起的Mann博士帶隊
...led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

489
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,380
每個人的著陸艙裡攜帶著兩年的補給
Each person's landing pod had enough life support for two years.

490
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,510
當然 他們可以用休眠來延長時間
But they could use hibernation to stretch that...

491
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,890
這樣對有機體的觀察時間可以長達十年或更久
...making observations on organics over a decade or more.

492
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,280
他們的任務是對所到之地進行評估
Their mission was to assess their world,

493
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,890
倘若發現可行性
and if it showed potential...

494
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,200
就發射信號
...then they could send out a signal,

495
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,650
然後進入休眠 等待救援
bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

496
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,860
如果那裡沒有生存條件呢
And what if the world didn't show promise?

497
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,900
所以要勇敢
Hence the bravery.

498
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,240
你們沒有足夠資源去探查十二個地方
You don't have the resources to visit all 12.

499
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,530
對
No.

500
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,200
以通過蟲洞的資料傳輸為基礎
Data transmission back through the Wormhole is rudimentary.

501
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,500
每年用簡單的二進位方式進行分析
Simple binary pings on an annual basis

502
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,410
我們得到了一些線索 哪些地方存在可能
give us some clue as to which worlds have potential.

503
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,370
有一個很有希望的星系
And one system shows promise.

504
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,250
就一個 不覺得風險有點大嗎
One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

505
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,920
一個星系 要是有三個可能的地方
One system with three potential worlds?

506
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,930
已經不錯了
No long shot.

507
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,220
好吧
Okay.

508
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,260
假設找到一個地方
So if we find a home...

509
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,400
- 然後呢  - 那才是真正的賭注
- ...then what? - That's the long shot.

510
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,940
有個A計畫 還有個B計畫
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

511
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,400
你發現發射室有什麼奇怪的地方嗎
Did you notice anything strange about the launch chamber?

512
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,040
整個設施就是個大型離心機
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

513
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,880
是運輸工具 還是空間站
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

514
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,960
都是 這是A計畫
Both. Plan A.

515
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,220
那怎麼離開地面呢
How do you get it off the ground?

516
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:19,050
第一次引力異常 顛覆了一切
The first gravitational anomalies changed everything.

517
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:23,720
我們明白了利用引力的可行性
Suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity was real.

518
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,750
於是我開始研究一個推論
So I started working on a theory

519
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,730
並且建造了這個空間站
and we started building this station.

520
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,190
但你還沒有驗證這個推論
But you haven't solved it yet.

521
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,820
所以才要有B計畫
That's why there's Plan B.

522
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,110
問題是地心引力
The problem is gravity. How to

523
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:39,030
如何才能把一定數量的人類帶離這個星球
get a viable amount of human life off the planet.

524
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,490
這是一個辦法
This is one way.

525
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,330
B計畫 超級人口炸彈
Plan B, a population bomb.

526
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:48,420
超過五千個受精卵 整體重量不超過九百公斤
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

527
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,630
怎麼養育它們
How would you raise them?

528
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,250
飛船上有設備 我們會先孵化十個
With equipment on board, we incubate the first 10.

529
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,300
這之後 用代孕的方式 讓人口指數倍增
After that, with surrogacy, the growth becomes exponential.

530
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,300
三十年後 就會有幾百人的殖民地了
Within 30 years, we could have a colony of hundreds.

531
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,850
不過殖民的真正難題是遺傳多樣性
The real difficulty with colonization is genetic diversity.

532
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,020
就靠這個解決了
This takes care of that.

533
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,650
那這裡的人怎麼辦
But what about the people here? You just...

534
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,360
就這麼放棄他們嗎
...give up on them?

535
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,230
我的孩子們
My kids?

536
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:17,110
所以 A計畫更好一些
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

537
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,240
- 進展到什麼程度了  - 差不多了
- How far have you got? - Almost there.

538
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,830
你要我放棄擁有的一切
You're asking me to hang everything...

539
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,200
去賭一個"差不多"
...on an almost.

540
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,040
我要你相信我
I'm asking you to trust me.

541
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,800
為我們找個新家
Find us a new home.

542
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,550
等你回來的時候
And by the time you return...

543
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,800
我就已經解決了引力的問題
...I will have solved the problem of gravity.

544
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,350
我向你保證
I give you my word.

545
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,490
走開
Go away!

546
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,210
Murph
Murph.

547
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,580
走開 你要走就走吧
Go! If you're leaving, just go.

548
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,210
這世界沒讓你滿足過 對嗎 Coop
This world was never enough for you, was it, Coop?

549
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,430
怎麼 就因為飛向太空
What, because heading out

550
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,800
是我心中與生俱來的使命
there is what I feel like I was born to do?

551
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,600
並且讓我激動不已嗎
And it excites me? Heh.

552
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,770
不 我覺得那沒有錯
No, that does not make it wrong.

553
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,060
未必
It might.

554
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,560
不要相信因為錯誤理由做出的正確事情
Don't trust the right thing done for the wrong reason.

555
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,650
做任何事情之前 都要搞清楚為什麼
The why of the thing, that's the foundation.

556
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,900
理由很充分
And the foundation's solid.

557
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,840
我們農民 就這樣坐著
We farmers, we sit here

558
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,080
每年要是沒有下雨 我們就會說
every year when the rains fail and we say:

559
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,620
明年吧
"Next year."

560
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,960
可是 明年救不了我們 後年也一樣
Well, next year ain't gonna save us, nor the one after that.

561
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,400
這裡曾是一片沃土 Donald
This world's a treasure, Donald,

562
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,920
但現在卻在逼迫我們離開
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

563
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,430
人類起源於此 並不意味著要結束於此
Mankind was born on Earth, it was never meant to die here.

564
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,660
Tom會沒事的
Tom will be all right,

565
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,770
但你要跟Murph好好說清楚
but you got to make things right with Murph.

566
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,980
我會的
I Will.

567
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,110
別隨便作出不能履行的承諾
Without making promises you don't know you can keep.

568
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,750
你得跟我談談 Murph
You have to talk to me, Murph.

569
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,370
走之前我得把這事解決了
I need to fix this before I go.

570
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,420
那我就不讓你解決 你就可以留下了
Then I'll keep it broken so you have to stay.

571
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,610
你們倆出生之後
After you kids came along,

572
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:45,010
你媽媽跟我說過一句話 我一直都沒弄明白
your mom said something to me I never quite understood.

573
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,010
她說 現在
She said, "Now...

574
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:53,390
我們就是孩子們以後的回憶了
...we're just here to be memories for our kids."

575
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,030
現在我明白她的意思了
And I think that now I understand what she meant.

576
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,530
一旦為人父母 你就成了孩子們未來的幽靈
Once you're a parent, you're the ghost of your children's future.

577
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,330
你說過幽靈不存在的
You said ghosts didn't exist.

578
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,290
沒錯 Murph
That's right, Murph.

579
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,840
Murph 看著我
Murph, look at me.

580
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,390
我現在還不能當你的幽靈
I can't be your ghost right now.

581
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,180
我必須存在
I need to exist.

582
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,730
他們選擇了我
They chose me.

583
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,400
Murph 他們選擇了我 你看到了 是你把我領向他們的
Murph, they chose me. You saw. You're the one who led me to them.

584
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,530
所以你更不能去了
That's exactly why you can't go.

585
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,700
我破譯那個資訊了
I figured out the message.

586
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,330
- 一個詞 你知道是什麼嗎  - Murph
- One word. Know what it is? - Murph.

587
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,830
留下
"Stay."

588
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,090
- 它說留下 爸爸  - Murph
- It says, "Stay," Dad. - Murph.

589
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,500
你不相信我
You don't believe me.

590
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,470
看看這些書 看看這裡 它說留下
Look at the books! Look at this. It says, "Stay."

591
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,590
你為什麼不聽我說呢 它說留下
Why--? You're not listening! It says, "Stay!"

592
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,760
不 我會回來的
No, I'm coming back.

593
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,260
什麼時候
When'?

594
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,740
一個給你 一個給我

00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,840
再次見到人類的機會很渺茫
against ever seeing another human being again.

746
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,970
希望我們能讓至少三個感到驚喜
I'm hoping we can surprise at least three of them.

747
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,050
- Mann博士呢  - Mann博士
- How about Mann? - Dr. Mann?

748
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,140
他很了不起 是我們中最棒的
He's remarkable. He's the best of us.

749
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,070
他帶領十一個人
He inspired 11 people to follow

750
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,690
踏上了人類歷史上最孤獨的旅程
him on the loneliest journey in human history.

751
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:51,440
科學家 探險家
Scientists, explorers.

752
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:55,690
我最愛的也是這點 我們雖然會面對種種困難
That's what I love. You know, out there we face great odds.

753
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:57,610
甚至死亡
Death, but...

754
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,700
但不會有邪惡
...not evil.

755
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,740
你不認為自然是邪惡的
You don't think nature can be evil?

756
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,790
不 很殘酷 很恐怖 但
No. Formidable. Frightening. But...

757
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,580
絕不是邪惡
...no, not evil.

758
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:13,040
因為獅子把羚羊撕碎 它就邪惡嗎
Is a lion evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

759
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,550
只是我們自己的感覺而已
Just what we take with us, then.

760
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,130
對
Yeah.

761
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,630
這一組人代表了最優秀的人類
This crew represents the best of humanity.

762
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,970
也包括我嗎
Even me, huh?

763
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:23,140
知道嗎 我們90%同意
You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.

764
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,390
感激不盡
There you go.

765
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,180
- 別待著了  - 就待一會兒
- Don't stay up. - I'll be there in a minute.

766
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:31,390
記著 Coop 現在空氣有限 吸一口少一口
Just remember, Coop, you are literally wasting your breath.

767
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:41,240
嘿 TARS 我們再研究一遍航行軌跡
Hey, TARS? Let's go over that trajectory one more time.

768
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:43,240
八個月到火星
Eight months to Mars.

769
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,580
通過引力彈弓效應加速 十四個月到土星
Counter-orbital slingshot around. Fourteen months to Saturn.

770
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,160
什麼都沒變
Nothing's changed on that.

771
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:50,410
我問你一件事
Just let me ask you something.

772
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,900
Brand博士和Edmunds
Dr. Brand and Edmunds--

773
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,130
幹嘛要竊竊私語 他們又聽不見
Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

774
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:00,590
Brand博士和Edmunds 他們很親近嗎
Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?

775
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,180
我不知道
I wouldn't know.

776
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,640
是不知道
Is that 90 percent "Wouldn't

777
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,350
還是不能說
know" Or 10 percent "Wouldn't know"?

778
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:08,640
我還有酌情處置功能 Cooper
I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.

779
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,270
可惜是張撲克臉 小子
But not a poker face, Slick.

780
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:25,870
嘿 孩子們
Hey, guys.

781
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,370
爸爸馬上就要去睡大覺了
Uh, Dad's about to go down for the long nap.

782
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,330
想在睡前跟你們再聊一會兒
So I wanted to give you an update.

783
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:37,880
從這裡看地球真奇妙
The Earth looks amazing from here. Um...

784
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,260
看不見任何塵土
You can't see any of the dust. Heh.

785
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,550
希望你們兩個都好好的
Um, I really hope you guys are doing great.

786
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,530
我知道你們肯定能收到這段視頻
I know you'll get this message.

787
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:50,140
Brand教授跟我保證過 會讓你們看到
Professor Brand's assured me he'll get it to you.

788
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,730
記住 我愛你們
Know that I love you.

789
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,480
- 是爸爸嗎  - 應該不是 Murph
- Is it him? - I don't think so, Murph.

790
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,030
你一定是Donald
You must be Donald.

791
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,410
你好 Murph
Hello, Murph.

792
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,160
你為什麼開著我爸爸的車
Why are you in my dad's truck?

793
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,960
他讓我開回來給你哥哥
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.

794
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,880
他給你們傳了一段視頻
He sent you a message.

795
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,960
他的離開讓她很難過
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.

796
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,780
你們也可以錄些東西
If you record any messages,

797
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,220
由我傳送給Cooper
I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.

798
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,970
Murph像朵耀眼的火花
Murph is a bright spark.

799
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,520
也許我能再加把火
Maybe I should fan the flame.

800
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,270
她的老師已經感覺力不從心了
She's already making fools of her teachers.

801
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,270
所以也許她應該來給你們出出難題
So maybe she should come and make a fool out of you.

802
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,190
- 他們現在在哪兒  - 前往火星的路上
- So where are they? - Heading for Mars.

803
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,030
你們下次聽到Cooper的消息時
The next time you hear from Cooper,

804
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:47,910
他們應該在去土星的路上了
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

805
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,440
學校方面 他們想讓我重修植物病理學
As far as school goes the administration wants me to repeat Plant Pathology.

806
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,910
真討厭
Which sucks.

807
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:36,620
不過 我可以提前一年學習高等農業
But they said I could start Advanced Agriculture a year early.

808
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:42,290
好了 我得走了 爸爸 你多保重
All right, I got to go, Dad. Hope you're safe up there.

809
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,920
抱歉 Coop
Um, sorry, Coop.

810
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:52,930
我叫Murph來打個招呼 但是她和你一樣固執
I asked Murph to say hi, but she's as stubborn as her old man.

811
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,180
我下次再試試吧
I'll try again next time.

812
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,780
你沒事吧 Rom
You all right, Rom?

813
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,950
這太恐怖了 Cooper
This gets to me, Cooper.

814
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,790
瞧 這兒
This. This.

815
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:21,170
我們被幾毫米的鋁板保護著 然後就什麼也沒有了
Millimeters of aluminum, that's it, and then nothing...

816
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:25,300
在太空裡 我們可能瞬間就會沒命
...out there for millions of miles won't kill us in seconds.

817
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:28,130
你知道嗎 很多世界上頂尖的
You know that some of the finest...

818
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,140
單人帆船運動員都不會游泳
...solo yachtsmen in the world don't know how to swim?

819
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,690
他們不會游泳
They don't know how.

820
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,890
一旦落水 他們就完蛋了
And if they go overboard, psst, they're done.

821
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,600
我們是探險家 Rom
We're explorers, Rom.

822
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,850
這就是我們的船
This is our boat.

823
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,150
給
Here.

824
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,010
這是探測器傳過來的嗎
This is from the, uh, relay probe?

825
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,220
蟲洞附近的軌道傳過來的
It was in orbit around the Wormhole.

826
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,770
這裡是蟲洞 每當我們經過這裡的時候
This is the Wormhole, and every time we'd come around...

827
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:20,160
都會收到
...we would receive images

828
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,140
從外星系的另一端傳過來的圖像
from the other side of the foreign galaxy.

829
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,600
就像一個擺動的潛望鏡
Oh, yeah. Like swinging a periscope around.

830
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:25,860
正是
Exactly.

831
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,750
所以我們很快就會知道
So we got a pretty good idea

832
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,530
另一邊是什麼樣的了 對嗎
what we're gonna find on the other side, huh?

833
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:32,950
航向上來說 是的
Navigationally.

834
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:38,160
夥計們 我們將在大約三小時後接近蟲洞
Guys? We'll be approaching the Wormhole in about three hours.

835
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,580
嘿 Coop
Hey, Coop?

836
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,210
能停止旋轉嗎
Can we stop the spinning?

837
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:49,460
為什麼
Why?

838
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,970
因為我們已經近得可以看見它了
Because we're close enough to see it now?

839
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,930
好的
All right.

840
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:56,180
謝謝
Thanks.

841
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,890
那兒 就是它 蟲洞
There, that's it! That's the Wormhole!

842
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,850
說話別噴口水 Rom
Say it, don't spray it, Rom.

843
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,520
是球狀的
It's a sphere.

844
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:09,460
當然是球狀的 你以為
Of course it is. What, you--?

845
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,650
難道你以為是個洞嗎
You thought it would just be a hole?

846
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,950
不 只是所有我見過的插圖 都是
No, it's just that all the illustrations I've ever seen, they...

847
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:19,580
那些插圖是為了解釋它的原理
In the illustrations, they're trying to show you how it works.

848
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,120
如果說你要從這裡到那裡
So they say you want to go from here to there.

849
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:27,000
太遠了 對吧
But it's too far, right?

850
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,530
蟲洞可以把空間像這樣折疊起來
So a Wormhole bends space like this,

851
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,960
於是你可以抄近路了
so you can take a shortcut through...

852
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,880
從更高的緯度
...A higher dimension.

853
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:35,510
所以
Okay, so...

854
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,420
為了展現這個原理
...to show that, they've turned

855
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,760
他把三維空間換成二維空間
three-dimensional space into two dimensions...

856
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:43,890
於是蟲洞在二維空間就成了 圓
...which turns a Wormhole into two dimensions, a circle.

857
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,310
圓在三維空間是什麼
What's a circle in three dimensions?

858
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,020
- 球體  - 沒錯
- A sphere. - Exactly.

859
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,940
球狀的洞
A spherical hole.

860
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,320
是誰放在那裡的 我們該感謝誰呢
But who put it there? Who do we have to thank?

861
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,410
我誰也不謝
I'm not thanking anybody

862
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:59,410
除非我們能從這裡完整地出去
until we get out of here in one piece, Rom.

863
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,040
有什麼訣竅嗎 Doyle
Any trick to this, Doyle?

864
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,040
沒人知道
No one knows.

865
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,840
其他人都過去了 對吧
The others made it, right?

866
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,560
至少有幾個過去了
At least some of them.

867
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:58,670
大家準備跟我們的太陽系說再見吧
Everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system?

868
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,550
沒準兒是銀河系
To our galaxy.

869
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:04,510
開始吧
Here we go.

870
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:40,630
控制器在這裡沒有用 我們正在穿越高維空間
The controls won't work here. We're passing through the bulk.

871
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,070
這裡超過了三維
It's space beyond our three dimensions.

872
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:45,220
我們能做的只有記錄和觀察
All you can do is record and observe.

873
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,440
那是什麼
What is that?

874
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,650
我覺得就是他們
I think it's them.

875
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:03,820
是時空彎曲效應
Distorting space-time.

876
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:06,990
不 不要
Don't! Don't!

877
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,270
剛剛那是怎麼回事
What was that?

878
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,780
第一次握手
The first handshake.

879
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:43,490
我們
We're...

880
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,450
我們到了
We're here.

881
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,060
失聯的通訊資料傳送過來了
So the lost communications came through.

882
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:12,100
- 怎麼傳過來的  - 這邊的記憶體緩存了下來
- How? - The relay on this side cached them.

883
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,810
只是這些年的基礎資料 沒什麼特別
So years of basic data. No real surprises.

884
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:19,150
Miller的信號一直持續著
Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,

885
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:20,570
Mann博士的也是
as has Dr. Mann's. Um...

886
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:22,860
Edmunds的三年前就消失了
Edmunds' went down three years ago.

887
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,240
因為傳輸失敗嗎
Transmitter failure?

888
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,410
也許吧 失聯之前他一直在傳送信號
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up right until it went dark.

889
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,330
但是Miller的信號還是很強
But Miller's still looks good though, right?

890
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,790
因為我們正在靠近她
Because she's coming up fast.

891
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,250
不過有個麻煩的情況
With one complication.

892
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,670
這星球離卡岡圖亞比我們預計的要近
The planet is much closer to Gargantua than we thought.

893
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:40,500
- 卡岡圖亞  - 我們這麼稱呼黑洞
- Gargantua? - It's what we're calling the black hole.

894
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,960
Miller和Mann博士的星球都繞著它旋轉
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it.

895
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:44,600
Miller的已經處於臨界點
And Miller's is on the horizon?

896
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,340
就像在籃筐邊緣停留的籃球
As a basketball around a hoop.

897
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:48,510
在那裡登陸會讓我們非常接近黑洞
Landing there takes us dangerously close.

898
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,930
那麼大的黑洞會產生巨大的引力
And a black hole that big has a huge gravitational pull.

899
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,520
聽著 我可以利用那顆中子星來抵消黑洞的引力
Look, I could swing around that neutron star to decelerate.

900
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,560
不 不是這個 是時間的問題
No, it's not that. It's time.

901
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:01,520
那個星球的引力
The gravity on that planet will

902
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,240
會讓我們的時間比地球慢很多
slow our clock compared to Earth's drastically.

903
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,030
有多慢
How bad?

904
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,740
那個星球上的一小時相當於
Every hour we spend on that planet will be...

905
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,790
地球上的七年
...seven years back on Earth.

906
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:14,700
天哪
Jesus.

907
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,710
這就是相對論 夥計們
Well, that's relativity, folks.

908
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,580
好吧 我們不能就這樣登陸而不
Well, we can't just drop down there without...

909
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,630
Cooper 我們有任務
Cooper, we have a mission.

910
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,380
對 Doyle 我們是有任務 我們的A計畫
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission, and our mission Plan A is...

911
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:26,700
是找到一個星球
...to find a planet that can

912
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,720
使之成為現在地球上那些人的新家
habitate the people that are living on Earth now.

913
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,510
你不能只想著家人
You can't just think about your family.

914
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:31,720
你得放眼大局
Now you have to think bigger.

915
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:32,960
我想的是
I am thinking about my

916
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,100
我的家人和成千上萬的家庭 好嗎
family and millions of other families, okay?

917
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,720
等執行計畫的時候
Plan A does not work if the

918
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,520
人都已經死光了 那A計畫就沒有任何意義
people on Earth are dead by the time we pull it off.

919
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:42,480
不 不會的
No. It doesn't.

920
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,480
所以我們有B計畫
That's why there's a Plan B.

921
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,900
好吧 Cooper是對的
Okay. Cooper's right.

922
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:49,830
我們得把時間也當成一種資源
We need to think of time as a resource,

923
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:51,910
就像氧氣和食物 下去是有代價的
like oxygen and food. Going down will cost us.

924
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:55,450
聽我說
All right, look.

925
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,270
Mann博士的資料看起來很不錯
Dr. Mann's data is promising,

926
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:00,210
但是我們得花幾個月才能到那兒
but it will take months to get there.

927
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,590
Edmunds的就更遠了
And Edmunds', it's even further.

928
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,320
Miller的消息不多
Miller hasn't sent much, but what

929
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,920
但她說的很有希望 有水 有機物
she has is very promising. It's water, it's organics...

930
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:09,260
- 這可不是每天都能找到的  - 對 沒錯
- You don't find that every day. - No, you don't.

931
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:11,760
再想想將要消耗的資源 包括時間
And just think about the resources, including time...

932
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:14,430
在試圖回到這裡的過程中
...that would be spent trying to get back here.

933
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,350
- Romilly  - 什麼
- Romilly... - Yeah?

934
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,830
我們要離Miller的星球多遠
...how far off from Miller's

935
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:21,350
才能避免時間發生轉變
planet do we have to be to stay out of the time shift?

936
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,190
只要離開波峰就行
Just back from the cusp.

937
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,320
那就是這裡 在Miller星球的上空
All right, which is here, just outside of Miller's planet.

938
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,280
- 沒錯  - 好
- Right. - Okay.

939
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,990
這兒是卡岡圖亞 這兒是Miller的星球
Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet.

940
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,150
我們不能
Instead of taking the

941
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:35,330
繞著Miller的星球軌道
Endurance into orbit around Miller's planet...

942
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:38,370
那樣雖然節省燃料 但會消耗大量的時間
...which would conserve fuel, but we would lose a lot of time...

943
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:41,030
要是我們繞卡岡圖亞走更大的軌道
...what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua,

944
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:42,630
與Miller的星球平行
parallel with Miller's planet...

945
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:45,290
避開時間變化區 到這裡
...outside of this time shift, to here?

946
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:48,260
然後我們開漫遊者下去 把Miller和她的樣本接來
Then we take the Ranger down, we get Miller, we get her samples.

947
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:51,130
回來進行分析詢問 一進一出
We come back, we analyze, we debrief. We're in, we're out.

948
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,640
儘管費點燃料 但節省了很多時間
We lose a little fuel, but we save a whole lot of time.

949
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,640
- 這樣能行  - 計畫不錯
- That'll work. - That's good.

950
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:58,270
到了那裡可就沒時間瞎扯聊天了
There's no time for monkey business or chit-chat down there.

951
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:01,230
所以 TARS 你必須留在這裡
So, TARS, you should definitely stay here.

952
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:03,650
CASE 你跟我走 別人都可以留下
CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay.

953
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:05,540
如果你們要去幾年的話
If we're talking about a couple years,

954
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:07,400
我可以利用這個時間研究引力
I could use the time to research gravity.

955
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,530
觀察蟲洞 這對Brand教授來說意義重大
Observations from the Wormhole, that's gold to Professor Brand.

956
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:12,360
TARS 找一條卡岡圖亞的軌道
TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.

957
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:14,450
節省燃料 少用推進器
Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting,

958
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:17,280
但要確保在Miller星球的範圍內
but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.

959
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:20,000
- 明白嗎  - 我不會丟下你的
- You got it? - I wouldn't leave you behind...

960
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,210
Brand博士
...Dr. Brand.

961
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,500
- 準備好了嗎 CASE  - 是的
- You ready, CASE? - Yup.

962
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:31,970
- 你不太愛說話 是嗎  - 有TARS說就夠了
- You don't say much, do you? - TARS talks plenty for both of us.

963
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,220
脫離
Detach.

964
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,280
Romilly 看到引力值了嗎
Romilly, are you reading these forces?

965
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:44,480
難以置信
It's unbelievable.

966
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:49,820
真正的黑暗之心
A literal heart of darkness.

967
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:56,700
如果我們可以看到坍塌在裡面的星球
If we could just see the collapsed star inside...

968
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,620
看到奇點 就能解決引力的問題了
...the singularity, yeah, we'd solve gravity.

969
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,810
我們什麼都得不到嗎
And we can't get anything from it?

970
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:03,330
沒有什麼能從那兒離開
Nothing escapes that horizon.

971
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,830
連光都不行
Not even light.

972
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,200
答案就在那裡 卻沒辦法看見
The answer's there, just no way to see it.

973
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,500
這就是Miller的星球
There's Miller's planet.

974
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,510
再見 漫遊者
Goodbye, Ranger.

975
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:27,610
這比進入大氣層要快
This is fast for atmospheric entry.

976
01:06:27,770 --> 01:06:30,020
- 需要用推進器來減速嗎  - 不
- Should we use the thrusters to slow? - No.

977
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,820
不 我要用漫遊者的空氣動力學來節省燃料
I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics to save some fuel.

978
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,200
空氣制動
Air brake?

979
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,690
我們要快速著陸
We want to get down fast,

980
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:38,910
- 不是嗎  - 我們要安全著陸
- don't we? - We want to get there in one piece.

981
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:42,080
- 坐穩  - Brand Doyle 準備好
- Hang on. - Brand, Doyle, get ready.

982
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,430
- 我們應該減速  - 待在那兒別動 CASE
- We should ease! - Hands where I can see them, CASE.

983
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,920
我唯一的一次事故
The only time I went down was

984
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,930
就是因為在錯誤的時間減速
when a machine was easing at the wrong time.

985
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,940
- 小心一點  - 也能讓你送命 跟魯莽駕駛一樣
- A little caution-- - Can get you killed, like reckless driving.

986
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,270
- Cooper 速度太快了  - 我能搞定
- Cooper, it's too damn fast! - I got this.

987
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:18,110
- 要關掉聲音回饋嗎  - 不 我需要感受氣流
- Should I disable the feedback? - No. I need to feel the air.

988
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,290
好了
Here we go.

989
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:27,870
全都是水
It's just water!

990
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,880
生命的要素
The stuff of life.

991
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,750
一千二百米
Twelve hundred meters.

992
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,960
- 能找到目標點嗎  - 鎖定
- Do we have a fix on the beacon? - Got it!

993
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:37,760
- 你能操作嗎  - 我得調整速度
- Can you maneuver? - I'll need to shave some speed.

994
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,550
我要螺旋式下降 大家坐穩
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it. Everybody hang on!

995
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:44,010
七百米
Seven hundred.

996
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,140
等我指令 CASE 等我指令
On my cue, CASE. On my cue.

997
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,150
五百米
Five hundred meters.

998
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,660
點火
Fire!

999
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:18,300
姿勢很優雅
Very graceful.

1000
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,550
不
No.

1001
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,260
但是很有效率
But very efficient.

1002
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,930
你們還等什麼呢 走啊
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

1003
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:29,020
走 走 走
Go, go, go!

1004
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:32,690
這裡一個小時七年 分秒必爭啊
Seven years per hour here. Let's make it count!

1005
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,050
這邊
This way.

1006
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:04,640
差不多兩百米
About 200 meters.

1007
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,770
引力挺大的
The gravity's punishing.

1008
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:18,860
在太空飄太久了
Been floating through space too long?

1009
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,070
地球引力的130%
One hundred and thirty percent Earth gravity.

1010
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,410
快 快
Come on. Come on.

1011
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:28,870
- 什麼都沒有  - 應該就在這裡的
- There's nothing here. - Should be right here.

1012
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:33,790
如果信號是從這裡來的
If the signal's coming from here, then...

1013
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,590
她的發射器
Her beacon.

1014
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,770
已經是殘骸了
Wreckage.

1015
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,600
其他的部分呢
Where's the rest?

1016
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:57,610
在山那邊
Towards the mountains!

1017
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,280
那可不是山
Those aren't mountains.

1018
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,280
那是巨浪
They're waves.

1019
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:14,290
哦 該死 該死 該死
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1020
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:16,790
Cooper 那個浪正離我們遠去
COOPER". That one's moving away from us.

1021
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:24,970
我們得找到記錄儀
We need the recorder.

1022
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:37,400
Brand Doyle 回到漫遊者上來
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

1023
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,940
沒拿到她的資料 我是不會走的
We're not leaving without her data.

1024
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:42,440
馬上回來
Get back here now!

1025
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:44,320
我們沒有時間了
We do not have time!

1026
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,950
第二波浪就要來了 我們正趕上漲潮
The second wave is coming! We're in the middle of a swell.

1027
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,660
不 我拿到了
No, I got it.

1028
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:51,830
你給我馬上回到漫遊者上來
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

1029
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:58,880
Brand 馬上回來
Brand, get back here now!

1030
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,050
不 Cooper 你走 Cooper 走吧 我趕不上了
No, Cooper, go. Cooper, go. I can't make it.

1031
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,840
- 快走  - CASE 去救她
- Go! - CASE, go get her.

1032
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,640
- 走啊  - 起來 起來 Brand
- Go! - Get up. Get up, Brand!

1033
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,060
走 走 走
Go, go! Go!

1034
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,480
- 我趕不回去了  - 你可以的 你可以的
- I'm not gonna make it! - Yes, you are. Yes, you are!

1035
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,610
快點 CASE接到她了 快回來 Doyle
Come on, CASE has her! Get back here, Doyle!

1036
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,700
加油
Come on!

1037
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:36,870
快到艙口來
Get to the hatch!

1038
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:42,920
快 快 快
Go, go! Go!

1039
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,550
見鬼
Shit.

1040
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:51,890
手動關閉艙門
Manually overriding inside hatch!

1041
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:56,560
Cooper 等等
Cooper! Wait!

1042
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:07,570
引擎進水了 我必須把它關了
The engines are flooded! I'm gonna have to shut her down.

1043
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,350
天哪
Holy shit.

1044
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,110
抓緊
Hang on!

1045
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:20,600
CASE 怎麼回事
CASE, what's the problem?

1046
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:23,190
進水太多 要先排水
Too waterlogged. Let it drain.

1047
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:25,520
真該死
Goddamn it!

1048
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:28,000
我說了 別管我 為什麼不走
I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?

1049
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,360
我也說了 讓你趕快回來
And I told you to get your ass back here!

1050
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:33,010
區別是我們其中的一個隻想著任務
The difference is one of us was thinking about the mission!

1051
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:35,200
可你想的只有回家
You were thinking about getting home.

1052
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:39,370
我只是想做正確的事
I was trying to do the right thing!

1053
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,500
這話你跟Doyle說吧
Can you tell that to Doyle?

1054
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,960
- CASE 要用多長時間  - 45分鐘到一小時
- CASE, how much time? - Forty-five to an hour.

1055
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,090
生命的要素
The stuff of life, huh?

1056
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:52,170
這得付出多大的代價
What's this gonna cost us, Brand?

1057
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,300
很大 幾十年
A lot. Decades.

1058
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,850
Miller是什麼情況
What happened to Miller?

1059
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,360
從殘骸判斷
Judging by the wreckage, she was...

1060
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,150
著陸後不久 她就被一股巨浪打碎了
...broken up by a wave soon after impact.

1061
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,150
這麼多年 為什麼這些殘骸還在這裡
How's the wreckage stayed together after all these years, huh?

1062
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,410
因為時間變慢了
Because of the time slippage.

1063
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:21,040
按這個星球上的時間 她幾個小時前才著陸
On this planet's time, she just landed hours ago.

1064
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:24,330
她可能幾分鐘前才死
She probably just died minutes ago.

1065
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,080
Doyle收到的資料
The data Doyle received was

1066
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,540
只是最初的狀態 在不斷重複
just the initial status echoing endlessly.

1067
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,090
我們對此完全沒有準備
Oh, we are not prepared for this.

1068
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:36,930
你們這些書呆子的生存技能和童子軍差不多
You eggheads have the survival skills of a Boy Scout troop.

1069
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:38,770
我們的智慧讓大家走到了這裡
Well, we got this far on our brains.

1070
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:40,350
走出了人類歷史上最遠的距離
Farther than any human in history.

1071
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:42,100
可這還遠遠不夠
Well, not far enough!

1072
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:43,820
現在我們被困在這裡
And now we're stuck here till

1073
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:45,940
一直到地球上都沒有人可以救為止
there won't be anyone left on Earth to save.

1074
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:51,650
我也在爭分奪秒 跟你一樣 Cooper
I'm counting every minute, same as you, Cooper.

1075
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,280
有沒有這種可能
Is there any possibility...

1076
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:02,080
我們想辦法跳進黑洞
...some kind of a way we can maybe all jump in a black hole?

1077
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,910
奪回失去的時間
Gain back the years?

1078
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,080
別對著我搖頭
Don't shake your head at me.

1079
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:08,250
時間是相對的 懂嗎
Time is relative, okay?

1080
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:11,460
既可以拉長也可以壓縮 但是
It can stretch and it can squeeze, but...

1081
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,170
但不能倒回去 不可能
...it can't run backwards. It just can't.

1082
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:15,810
唯一可以
The only thing that can

1083
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:18,760
像時間一樣跨越維度的 就是引力
move across dimensions, like time, is gravity.

1084
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:22,640
好吧
Okay.

1085
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:28,480
那些把我們引到這裡來的生命 他們通過
The beings that led us here, they communicate...

1086
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,480
- 引力交流 對吧  - 是的
- ...through gravity, right? - Yes.

1087
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:32,820
他們能從未來對我們說話嗎
Could they be talking to us from the future?

1088
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:35,990
- 也許吧  - 好的 如果他們能
- Maybe. - Okay. If they can...

1089
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,450
他們是五維空間的生命
"They" Are beings of five dimensions.

1090
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,200
時間可能是另一種空間的實體
To them, time might be another physical dimension.

1091
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,870
對他們來說
To them...

1092
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:47,990
過去也許就像個可以走進的峽谷
...the past might be a canyon

1093
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:50,460
未來 就是可以攀爬的山
that they can climb into and the future...

1094
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:53,630
但是對我們來說 是不可能的
...A mountain they can climb up. But to us, it's not, okay?

1095
01:15:54,710 --> 01:15:57,130
Cooper 我搞砸了 我很抱歉
Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

1096
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,050
但是你也知道相對論的
But you knew about relativity.

1097
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,550
噢
Oh.

1098
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,430
Brand
Brand...

1099
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:12,230
我女兒才十歲
...my daughter was 10 years old.

1100
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,650
我走之前還沒來得及教她愛因斯坦的理論
I couldn't teach her Einstein's theories before I left.

1101
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:18,900
你沒告訴你女兒你要去拯救世界了嗎
Couldn't you have told her you were going to save the world?

1102
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:20,530
沒有
No.

1103
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:26,370
當你變成父母後 你的首要任務是
When you become a parent, one thing becomes really clear.

1104
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:31,040
讓你的孩子有安全感
And that is that you want to make sure your children feel safe.

1105
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,840
所以不能告訴一個十歲的孩子 世界末日要來了
And it rules out telling a 10-year-old that the world is ending.

1106
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,670
Cooper
Cooper?

1107
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,890
- 還有多久引擎準備好 CASE  - 一兩分鐘
- How long for the engines, CASE? - A minute or two.

1108
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,140
沒時間了 戴上頭盔
We don't have it. Helmets on!

1109
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:53,860
Brand 來副駕駛
Brand, co-pilot, you're up.

1110
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:56,530
CASE 把艙內氧氣加入主推動器
CASE, blow the cabin oxygen through the main thrusters!

1111
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:58,400
- 準備點火  - 收到
- We're gonna spark it. - Roger that.

1112
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:00,030
- 就位  - 釋放壓力
- Locked. - Depressurizing.

1113
01:17:05,910 --> 01:17:07,160
引擎啟動
Engines up!

1114
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,520
你好 Rom
Hello, Rom.

1115
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,650
我等了好多年了
I've waited years.

1116
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,570
多 多少年
How--? How many years?

1117
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,370
- 到現在  - 二十三年
- By now it must be... - Twenty-three years...

1118
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:49,240
四個月零八天
...four months, eight days.

1119
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:54,830
Doyle呢
Doyle?

1120
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:04,050
我以為我準備好了 我精通理論
I thought I was prepared. I knew the theory.

1121
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:06,930
可現實是完全不同的
Reality's different.

1122
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:09,140
Miller呢
And Miller?

1123
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,730
那裡什麼都沒有
There's nothing here for us.

1124
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,980
你怎麼不睡覺
Why didn't you sleep?

1125
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:19,640
我睡了好幾覺了
Oh, I had a couple of stretches.

1126
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:22,030
我以為你們不會回來了
But I stopped believing you were coming back.

1127
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:25,530
我想 把生命就這樣睡掉也太浪費了
And something seemed wrong about dreaming my life away.

1128
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,200
我從黑洞裡學到了很多
I learned what I could from the black hole...

1129
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,040
但是卻不能傳給你父親
...but I couldn't send anything to your father.

1130
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,460
我們能收到資訊 卻發不出去
We've been receiving, but nothing gets out.

1131
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:36,710
- 他還活著嗎  - 還活著
- ls he alive? - Oh, yeah.

1132
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:38,920
- 真的  - 真的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1133
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,930
這些年的資訊都存著呢
We've got years of messages stored.

1134
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,380
Cooper
Cooper.

1135
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:49,550
一共有二十三年的資訊
Messages span 23 years.

1136
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,270
從頭開始放
Play it from the beginning.

1137
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:58,020
嗨 爸爸
Hey, Dad.

1138
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:01,270
我只是來說句話 打個招呼
Checking in. Saying hi.

1139
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,860
呃
Um...

我畢業了 成績第二
Finished second in school.

1141
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,820
Carlin女士還是總給我C
Miss Kurling's still giving me C's though.

1142
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,950
說我沒追求吧 但我覺得第二還不賴
Pulled me down, but seconds not bad.

1143
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,290
外公來參加了畢業典禮
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

1144
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,920

我覺得就是她了
I really think this is the one.

1148
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,220
她的名字是Lois 這就是她
Name's Lois. That's her right there.

Murphy偷了外公的車

1151
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:41,360
嗨 爸
Hey, Dad.

1152
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:43,610

Look at this!

1153

你當爺爺了
You're a grandpa.

1154

他的名字是Jesse
His name's Jesse.

1155
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,960
我本來想叫他Coop的
I kind of wanted to call him Coop,

1156
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,290
但是Lois說下一胎吧
but Lois says, uh, maybe next time.

1157
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:57,770
Donald說他已經是曾祖父了
Donald says he's already earned the "Great" Part,

1158
01:19:57,770 --> 01:19:59,370
別的就算了
so we just leave it at that.

1159
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,340
噢 乖 乖
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

1160
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:06,760

Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."

1161

說爺爺再見
Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.

抱歉 有一陣沒留消息了
Sorry it's been a while.

1169
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:36,790
那原本是我們給你留的位置 如果你還
Which is where we would have buried you if you'd ever...

1170
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:39,040

Murph來參加了葬禮

我們不常見到她 但是那次她來了
We don't see her that much, but she came for that.

1173
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,800
你不會聽到這些的 我知道
You aren't listening to this, I know that.

1174
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:57,680
所有的這些資訊
All these messages are just, like...

1175
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:02,520
只是飄在無邊的黑暗中
...drifting out there in the darkness.

1176
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:05,940
Lois說
Lois says that, uh...

1177
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:09,490
我得放下你

呃
And, uh...

1179
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,280
所以
...so...

1180
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:19,620
我想 我最終會釋懷的
...I guess I'm letting you go.

1181
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:23,250
我不知道你在哪兒 爸
I don't know where you are, Dad...

1182
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,500
但是我希望你享有寧靜
...but I hope that you're at peace.

1183
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,380
再見
Goodbye.

1184

你這個大混蛋
You son of a bitch.

1187
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:56,530
你在回信的時候我從來沒留過言
I never made one of these when you were still responding...

1188
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:59,040
因為我還在為你的離開生氣
...because I was so mad at you for leaving.

1189
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,170
但是當你失去音信的時候
And then when you went quiet, it...

1190
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:09,630
我覺得都是我自作自受
...seemed like I should live with that decision. And I have.

1191
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:16,550
但今天是我的生日
But today's my birthday.

1192
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:23,390
這個生日很特別 因為你告訴過我
And it's a special one, because you told me...

1193
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,220
你說你回來的時候
You once told me that when you came back,

1194
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:31,860
我們也許是一樣的年紀了
we might be the same age.

1195
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:36,660
今天我就到你離開時的年紀了
And today I'm the age you were when you left.

1196
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:41,740
所以現在就是你應該回來的時候了
So it would be a real good time for you to come back.

1197
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:57,650
我不是故意打擾你
I didn't mean to intrude.

1198
01:22:57,650 --> 01:23:00,510
只是我從來沒有在這裡見過你
It's just that I've never seen you in here before.

1199
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,310
因為我沒有來過
I've never been in here before.

1200
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:08,190
我總是和Amelia說話
I talk to Amelia all the time.

1201
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:10,020
有幫助的
It helps.

1202
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:13,440
- 我很高興你也開始這麼做了  - 我沒有 我
- I'm glad you've started. - I haven't. I--

1203
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:16,110
只是有一些必須說出來的話
I just had something I needed to get out.

1204
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,870
- 我知道他們還活著  - 我知道
- I know they're still out there. - I know.

1205
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:20,770
有很多原因可以導致
There are so many reasons their

1206
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:23,240
我們的資訊無法正常傳輸
communications might not be getting through.

1207
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:24,830
我知道 教授
I know, professor.

1208
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:28,370
我都不清楚 我更怕什麼
I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.

1209
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:31,880
他們永遠不回來
Them never coming back or...

1210
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:36,300
還是回來了 發現我們失敗了
...coming back to find we've failed.

1211
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:37,880
那我們成功就好了
Then let's succeed.

1212
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:39,970
那麼
So...

1213
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,530
回到第四反覆運算
...back to the fourth iteration.

1214
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:44,680
我們用新的引力場試試
Let's run it through some new fields.

1215
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:48,190
不是有意冒犯 教授 我們已經試了上百次了
With respect, professor, we've tried that hundreds of times.

1216
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:52,190
只要一次成功就行了 Murph
It only has to work once, Murph.

1217
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:59,360
他們敲擊的每顆鉚釘都有可能是子彈
Every rivet that they strike could have been a bullet.

1218
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:01,530
我們做得不錯 在這邊的世界
We've done well for the world here...

1219
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:06,450
不管我死前有沒有解出方程式
...whether or not we crack the equation before I kick the bucket.

1220
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:09,500
- 別這麼消極 教授  - 我不怕死
- Don't be morbid, professor. - I'm not afraid of death.

1221
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:12,090
我是個老物理家
I'm an old physicist.

1222
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,000
我害怕時間
I'm afraid of time.

1223
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:23,350
時間
Time.

1224
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:27,060
你害怕時間
You're afraid of time.

1225
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,650
我們一直以來試圖解出這個方程的
We've been trying to solve the equation...

1226
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:34,320
前提條件是時間不變
...without changing the underlying assumption about time.

1227
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,190
- 所以呢  - 這表示
- And? - And that means...

1228
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:40,820
每一個反覆運算都只是在嘗試自我證明
...each iteration is an attempt to prove its own proof.

1229
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:43,120
這是遞迴 是沒有意義的
It's recursive. It's nonsensical.

1230
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:45,330
你是說我一生的努力都是
Are you calling my life's work...

1231
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:47,200
無意義的嗎 Murph
...nonsense, Murph?

1232
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:49,410
不 我是說你一直都
No, I'm saying that you've been trying to...

1233
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:51,240
在把一隻手 不
...finish it with one arm... No,

1234
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,380
是兩隻手綁在背後來解決問題
with both arms. --tied behind your back.

1235
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:57,460
我不明白為什麼
And I don't understand why.

1236
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:00,260
我是個老人 Murph
I'm an old man, Murph.

1237
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:03,800
我們能另找時間談麼
Can we take this point up at another time?

1238
01:25:03,970 --> 01:25:06,100
我想和我女兒說說話
I want to talk to my daughter.

1239
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,730
離開地球 走進宇宙
Stepping out into the universe...

1240
01:25:10,890 --> 01:25:14,690
我們就必須面對星際穿越的真實情況
...we must confront the reality of interstellar travel.

1241
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:20,150
我們必須超越自己的生命範疇
We must reach far beyond our own lifespans.

1242
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:25,450
我們思考時 不能把自己當做個體而是作為一個種族
We must think not as individuals but as a species.

1243
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:30,910
不要溫順地走入那長夜
Do not go gentle into that good night

1244
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,670
TARS把飛船停在了預定地點
TARS kept the Endurance right where we needed her.

1245
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,630
但是這趟旅行比我們計畫的時間長
But the trip took years longer than we anticipated.

1246
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:42,470
我們的燃料不夠去所有的星球 所以
We no longer have the fuel to visit both prospects, so...

1247
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,300
我們必須抉擇
...we have to choose.

1248
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:46,640
怎麼選
But how?

1249
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,350
它們都很有潛力
They're both promising.

1250
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:52,870
Edmunds的數據要好點
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr.

1251
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:55,400
但是Mann博士的星球一直在傳信號
Mann is the one still transmitting, so...

1252
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,480
我們沒有理由懷疑Edmund的資料不好
We've no reason to suspect Edmunds's data would have soured.

1253
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,900
他那兒有所有支撐人體生命的元素
His world has key elements to sustain human life.

1254
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:05,240
- Mann博士的也是  - Cooper 這是我的專業領域
- As does Dr. Mann's. - Cooper, this is my field.

1255
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:07,450
並且
And...

1256
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,410
我真的覺得Edmund那裡更有希望
...I really believe Edmunds' is the better prospect.

1257
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:13,920
- 為什麼  - 卡岡圖亞 這就是原因
- Why? - Gargantua, that's why.

1258
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:19,090
看看Miller的星球吧 碳氧化合物 有機物 都有
Look at Miller's planet. Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

1259
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:23,680
但是沒有生命 一片荒涼 在Mann的星球上我們也會面臨同樣的情況
...but no life. Sterile. We'll find the same thing on Mann's.

1260
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:25,760
因為黑洞嗎
Because of the black hole?

1261
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:29,100
墨菲定律 有可能發生的就一定會發生
Murphy's Law. Whatever can happen will happen.

1262
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:31,600
意外是進化的第一塊積木
Accident is the first building block of evolution.

1263
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,600
但是當你繞著黑洞的軌道 就沒有足夠的意外發生
But when you're orbiting a black hole not enough can happen.

1264
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:36,590
小行星和彗星都被吞噬了
It sucks in asteroids and comets,

1265
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:39,070
要不我們怎麼一個也沒遇見
other events which would otherwise reach you.

1266
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,280
我們得走的更遠一點
We need to go further afield.

1267
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,240
你曾經說過 Mann博士
You once said that Dr. Mann...

1268
01:26:45,490 --> 01:26:46,990
是我們中最棒的
...was the best of us.

1269
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,450
他很了不起 我們在這兒就是因為他
He's remarkable. We're only here because of him.

1270
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:52,830
現在他就在這裡
And yet-- Yet here he is.

1271
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,800
在那個星球上
He's on the ground, and he's

1272
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,960
給我們發來明確的資訊 讓我們
sending a very unambiguous message, telling us...

1273
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,840
去他的星球
...to come to his planet.

1274
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,630
有道理 但是Edmunds的資料前景更好
Granted, but Edmunds' data is more promising.

1275
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:06,130
我們應該投票
We should vote.

1276
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,470
好吧 要是投票的話 有件事你應該要知道
Well, if we vote, there's something you should know.

1277
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,640
Brand
Brand?

1278
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:12,470
他有權知道
He has a right to know.

1279
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,730
那與此無關
That has nothing to do with it.

1280
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:17,940
- 什麼事  - 她和Wolf Edmunds是戀人關係
- What does? - She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.

1281
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:20,650
- 是真的麼  - 是的
- ls that true? - Yes.

1282
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:26,530
這讓我想聽從內心的聲音
And that makes me want to follow my heart.

1283
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:31,280
也許我們花了太多的時間
But maybe we've spent too

1284
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,660
試著用理論解釋一切
long trying to figure all this outwith theory.

1285
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:35,250
你是個科學家 Brand
You're a scientist, Brand.

1286
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:36,960
那就聽我的
So listen to me...

1287
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:42,500
愛不是我們發明的東西
...when I say that love isn't something we invented. It's...

1288
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,840
它一直存在而且很強大
...observable, powerful.

1289
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,640
它是有意義的
It has to mean something.

1290
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,180
愛是有意義的 沒錯
Love has meaning, yes. Social utility,

1291
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:54,180
社會效益 人際交往 繁衍後代
social bonding, child rearing...

1292
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:57,850
我們愛那些逝去的人 這有什麼社會效益
We love people who have died. Where's the social utility in that?

1293
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:59,440
沒有
None.

1294
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:03,480
也許這有更深的意義 那些
Maybe it means something more, something we can't...

1295
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:05,690
我們還無法理解的
...yet understand.

1296
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:09,320
也許是一些證據 一些
Maybe it's some evidence, some...

1297
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,790
更高維度的文明
...artifact of a higher

1298
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:14,740
只是我們目前還不能感知
dimension that we can't consciously perceive.

1299
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:16,930
我被牽引著穿越星河宇宙
I'm drawn across the universe

1300
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:19,710
去見一個數年未見的人
to someone I haven't seen in a decade...

1301
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:22,710
一個我知道可能早就死了的人
...who I know is probably dead.

1302
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,380
愛是我們唯一能夠感知的
Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving...

1303
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:29,380
超越時空維度的事物
...that transcends dimensions of time and space.

1304
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:35,560
或許我們應該相信它 即使我們還未完全理解它
Maybe we should trust that, even if we can't understand it yet.

1305
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,230
好吧 Cooper
All right, Cooper...

1306
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:45,400
我承認
...yes...

1307
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:49,900
能見到Wolf的幾率即使再小也讓我激動不已
...the tiniest possibility of seeing Wolf again excites me.

1308
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:52,410
但這並不意味著我錯了
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

1309
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,280
老實說 Amelia
Honestly, Amelia...

1310
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,250
也許你錯了
...it might.

1311
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,760
TARS 繪出到Mann博士星球的航線
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

1312
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:26,110
我們又要損失三分之一了
We'll lose about a third again.

1313
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:27,820
但明年
But next year...

1314
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:32,950
明年我會去Nelson的農場工作 把損失補上
Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm and we'll make it up.

1315
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:35,620
Nelson怎麼了
What happened to Nelson?

1316
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:43,750
Murph 你還要點蛋奶酥嗎
Murph, would you like some more souffle'?

1317
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,300
不了 我飽了 謝謝 很好吃
Oh, no. I'm full, thanks. It was delicious.

1318
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:50,170
Coop 把食物吃完
Coop, finish your fritter, please.

1319
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:53,610
你要留下來過夜嗎
Will you spend the night?

1320
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:56,050
你的臥室和原來一模一樣
Your room is exactly as you left it. It's ready.

1321
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,600
我得回去了
I need to get back.

1322
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,310
我的縫紉機在那兒 但是還有很多
My sewing machine is in there, but there's plenty--

1323
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:01,770
我得回去
l need to....

1324
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,190
那裡有太多回憶了
Too many memories.

1325
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:09,610
好吧 我們有辦法解決 嘿 Coop
We might have something for that. Hey, Coop.

1326
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,450
灰太大
The dust.

1327
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:23,330
Lois 我有一個朋友
Lois, I have a friend who...

1328
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,330
可以幫他檢查一下肺部
...could look at his lungs.

1329
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:46,190
- Amelia 對不起  - 你只是客觀分析
- Amelia, I'm sorry. - You were just being objective.

1330
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:49,820
除非你是想懲罰我在Miller星球上犯的錯
Unless you're punishing me for screwing up on Miller's planet.

1331
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:52,230
不 這並不是私人恩怨
No, this wasn't a personal decision.

1332
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:57,110
如果你錯了 就有一個很私人的決定等著你了
If you're wrong, you will have a very personal decision to make.

1333
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,240
你是參照回航的需求計算的燃料
Your fuel calculations are based on a return journey.

1334
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,970
如果我們去Mann的星球
Strike out on Mann's planet,

1335
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:04,460
你就得決定是要回到地球
and we'll have to decide whether to return home...

1336
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:06,870
還是去Edmunds星球實行B計畫
...or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.

1337
01:31:07,210 --> 01:31:10,880
建立殖民地能讓我們免於種族滅絕
Starting a colony could save us from extinction.

1338
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:14,380
你或許得決定是回去和你的孩子們相聚
You might have to decide between seeing your children again...

1339
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:16,380
還是去創造人類的未來
...and the future of the human race.

1340
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:19,600
我相信你那時一定會很客觀
I trust you'll be as objective then.

1341
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,400
他醒過來後一直要求見你
He's been asking for you since he came to.

1342
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,190
我們就設法聯繫了你
We were trying to reach you.

1343
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:37,200
Murph
Murph.

1344
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,700
我在這兒 教授
I'm here, professor.

1345
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:42,740
我讓大家失望了
I let you all down.

1346
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:46,410
不 你引領我們走了很遠了 馬上就要成功了
No, you got us so far. Real close.

1347
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:50,040
我會完成你的研究
I'll finish what you started.

1348
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:52,420
好 很好 Murph
Good, good Murph.

1349
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:57,010
你有信念
You had faith...

1350
01:31:58,220 --> 01:31:59,510
這麼多
...all those...

1351
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:02,260
這麼多年來
...all those years.

1352
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:05,180
我
I...

1353
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:07,850
我要你堅守信念
I asked you to have faith.

1354
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,400
我想要你相信
I wanted you to believe...

1355
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:15,780
你父親
...that your father...

1356
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:20,610
一定會回來
...would come back.

1357
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:22,070
教授 我相信
I do, professor.

1358
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:25,200
原諒我 Murph
Forgive me, Murph.

1359
01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:27,960
沒有什麼需要原諒的
There's nothing to forgive.

1360
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:31,670
我
I.

1361
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:34,090
我說謊了 Murph
I lied, Murph.

1362
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:38,260
我騙了你
I lied to you.

1363
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,810
他根本沒必要
There was no need for him to...

1364
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:50,900
再回來
To come back.

1365
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:56,820
我們沒有希望了
There is no way to help us.

1366
01:32:58,110 --> 01:32:59,150
但是A計畫呢
But Plan A...

1367
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:02,820
所有的這一切呢 所有的這些人
All this. All these people.

1368
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:05,740
還有這個方程
And the equation.

1369
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:11,500
我父親知道嗎
Did my father know?

1370
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:17,000
是他拋棄了我嗎
Did he leave me?

1371
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:22,010
不要
Do...

1372
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,510
溫順
...not...

1373
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:26,720
地
...go...

1374
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:29,520
走進
...gentle...

1375
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,690
不
No.

1376
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:35,440
不要
No!

1377
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:38,320
你不能走
You can't leave.

1378
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:39,940
你 不
You-- No.

1379
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:42,750
Brand博士 我很遺憾地
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to

1380
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:45,700
告訴你 你父親今天去世了 他走的時候很平和
tell you that your father died today. He had no pain.

1381
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:47,950
沒有遭受一絲痛苦
He was at peace.

1382
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:50,700
我很遺憾 請你節哀
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1383
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:04,970
Brand 你知道嗎
Brand, did you know?

1384
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:09,060
他早就告訴你了吧
He told you, right?

1385
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:13,310
你知道的
You knew.

1386
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:17,020
這一切都是騙局
This was all a sham.

1387
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,490
你們把我們扔在這兒
You left us here.

1388
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:26,740
任我們窒息
To suffocate.

1389
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:30,240
餓死
To starve.

1390
01:34:57,610 --> 01:34:58,940
是凍雲
Frozen cloud.

1391
01:36:07,362 --> 01:36:10,362
曼恩博士

1392
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,750
沒事了
It's okay.

1393
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,340
沒事了
It's okay.

1394
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:34,680
都過去了
It's okay.

1395
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:42,100
希望你永遠都不會知道
Pray you never learn...

1396
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:46,610
再次見到人類有多美好
...just how good it can be to see another face.

1397
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:57,530
開始的時候我沒報多大希望
I hadn't a lot of hope to begin with, but...

1398
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:00,040
過了很久 更是希望全無
...after so long, I had none.

1399
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:04,540
我的補給品全部用完了
My supplies were completely exhausted.

1400
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:10,260
最後一次休眠 我甚至都沒設置喚醒日期
The last time I went to sleep, I didn't even set a waking date.

1401
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:16,550
你們真正地讓我起死回生了
You have literally raised me from the dead.

1402
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,770
- 拉撒路  - 嗯
- Lazarus. - Hm.

1403
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:23,940
- 其他人呢  - 恐怕就剩你了
- What about the others? - l'm afraid you're it, sir.

1404
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:27,060
你是說到目前為止 當然了
So far, surely.

1405
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:29,740
不 以我們現在的狀況
No, our present situation is that

1406
01:38:29,740 --> 01:38:32,650
幾乎不可能援救其他人了
there's very little chance of rescuing any others.

1407
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:38,620
Mann博士 Mann博士
Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?

1408
01:38:39,490 --> 01:38:41,290
跟我們說說你的星球
Tell us about your world.

1409
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:46,540
希望是我們的星球
Our world, we hope.

1410
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:52,670
我們的星球很冷
Our world, uh, is cold...

1411
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:54,130
荒涼
...stark...

1412
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:57,850
但不可否認它也很美
...but undeniably beautiful.

1413
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:03,350
白天有67個小時 很冷
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

1414
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:09,110
夜晚是
The nights are...

1415
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:11,610
更冷的67個小時
...67 far colder hours.

1416
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:21,790
引力只有地球的百分之八十 很舒服
The gravity is a very, very pleasant 80 percent of the Earth's.

1417
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:24,960
這裡 我登陸的地方 水質是鹼性的
Now, up here where I landed, the water is alkali...

1418
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:26,910
空氣裡氨氣的比重很大
...and the air has too much ammonia

1419
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:29,040
呼吸幾分鐘就受不了了
to breathe for more than just a few minutes...

1420
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:33,800
但是 在它的表層下面還有一層
...but down at the surface, and there is a surface...

1421
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,590
在這層 氯氣開始消散
...the chlorine dissipates.

1422
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,130
氨氣也轉化成
The ammonia gives way to

1423
01:39:37,130 --> 01:39:39,640
結晶性烴和可供有機體呼吸
crystalline hydrocarbons and breathable air.

1424
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:41,470
的空氣
To organics.

1425
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:44,140
也許甚至可供生命體呼吸
Possibly even to life.

1426
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:46,890
我們也許能共用這個星球
We might be sharing this world.

1427
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,400
這些是表層的讀數嗎
These readings are from the surface?

1428
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:52,730
這些年 我放了很多探測器
Over the years, I've dropped various probes.

1429
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:54,410
你勘探了多遠
How far have you explored?

1430
01:39:54,410 --> 01:39:56,490
我設法進行了幾次主要的遠征探險
l've mounted several major expeditions.

1431
01:39:56,650 --> 01:39:58,560
但是由於氧氣有限
But with oxygen in limited supply,

1432
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,910
大部分跑腿的工作都是KIPP完成的
KIPP there really did most of the legwork.

1433
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:03,540
- 它怎麼了  - 性能老化
- What went wrong with him, sir?  - Degeneration.

1434
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:07,290
它將我們發現的第一個有機體誤當成了氨結晶
He misidentified the first organics we found as ammonia crystals.

1435
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:09,070
我們掙扎了一段時間
We struggled on for a time,

1436
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:11,590
最終我還是讓它退役了
but ultimately I decommissioned him and...

1437
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:13,920
然後用他的電源來使任務繼續下去
...used his power source to keep the mission going.

1438
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:17,090
關掉它之前 我以為自己真的要孤身一人了
I thought I was alone before I shut him down.

1439
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:18,930
您能讓我檢查一下它嗎
Would you like me to look at him?

1440
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:21,600
不 不 它需要的是人類
No. No. He needs a human touch.

1441
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,580
Brand博士 CASE從空間站
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying

1442
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:26,270
給您傳來一個消息
a message for you from the comm station.

1443
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:28,890
好的 我馬上就來 不好意思
Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.

1444
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:43,490
Brand博士 我很遺憾地告訴你 你父親今天去世了
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that your father died today.

1445
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:45,830
他走的時候很平和 沒有遭受一絲痛苦
He had no pain. He was at peace.

1446
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:54,380
我為你的損失感到遺憾
I'm sorry for your loss.

1447
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:57,800
那是Murph嗎
ls that Murph?

1448
01:40:58,510 --> 01:41:00,970
她 她長大了
She's... She's grown.

1449
01:41:01,130 --> 01:41:02,720
你知道嗎 Brand
Brand, did you know?

1450
01:41:03,890 --> 01:41:05,560
他早就告訴你了吧
He told you, right?

1451
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:09,890
你知道的
You knew.

1452
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:13,150
這一切都是騙局
This was all a sham.

1453
01:41:14,190 --> 01:41:15,860
你們把我們扔在這兒
You left us here.

1454
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:19,490
任我們窒息
To suffocate.

1455
01:41:21,570 --> 01:41:22,950
餓死
To starve.

1456
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:27,870
我父親也知道嗎
Did my father know too?

1457
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:31,920
爸爸
Dad?

1458
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:35,590
我就是想知道
I just want to know...

1459
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:38,920
你是把我扔在這兒等死嗎
...if you left me here to die.

1460
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:43,510
我只想知道真相
I just have to know.

1461
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,430
Cooper 我
Cooper, my...

1462
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,850
我父親將畢生精力
My father dedicated...

1463
01:41:54,230 --> 01:41:56,290
獻給了A計畫
...his whole life to Plan A.

1464
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:59,230
我完全不知道她在說什麼
I have no idea what she's talking about.

1465
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:02,110
我知道
I do.

1466
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:09,910
他 他難道從未想過要把人類送出地球嗎
He never even hoped to get the people off the Earth?

1467
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:12,330
沒有
No.

1468
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:20,210
但他花了四十年的時間研究如何解引力方程式
But he's been trying to solve the gravity equation for 40 years.

1469
01:42:20,710 --> 01:42:24,130
Amelia 在我離開之前 你父親就已經解出這個方程了
Amelia, your father solved his equation before I even left.

1470
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:26,600
那他為什麼不用呢
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1471
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:28,300
因為這個方程不能調和
The equation couldn't reconcile

1472
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:30,720
相對論和量子力學 你還需要更多
relativity with quantum mechanics. You need more.

1473
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:32,810
更多 更多的什麼
More? More what?

1474
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:35,980
更多的資料 你得探進黑洞
More data. You need to see into a black hole.

1475
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:38,230
自然法則禁止了裸奇點
The laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity.

1476
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,900
Romilly 那是真的嗎
Romilly, is that true?

1477
01:42:41,190 --> 01:42:42,750
假設黑洞是個牡蠣
If a black hole is an oyster,

1478
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:44,910
那奇點就是裡面的珍珠了
then the singularity's the pearl inside.

1479
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:47,820
由於引力太大 導致它一直深藏在黑暗裡
The gravity's so strong, it's always hidden in darkness...

1480
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:49,410
在邊界之內
...behind the horizon.

1481
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:52,910
所以我們稱它為黑洞
That's why we call it a black hole.

1482
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:56,500
好吧 那如果我們能看到邊界之外呢
Okay, but if we see beyond the horizon...

1483
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,590
不可能的 Coop
We can't, Coop.

1484
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:01,250
有些事本不應該說出來的
There are some things that aren't meant to be known.

1485
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:03,280
你父親找到了另一個方法
Your father had to find another

1486
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,630
能使人類免於滅絕
way to save the human race from extinction.

1487
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,300
就是B計畫 殖民地
Plan B. A colony.

1488
01:43:07,470 --> 01:43:09,140
為什麼不說出來
Why not tell people?

1489
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:12,330
為什麼還要建那些空間站
Why keep building those stations?

1490
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:13,810
因為他知道這有多難
He knew how hard it would be...

1491
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:15,300
要讓人們齊心協力
...to get people to work

1492
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:18,110
去延續人類這一種群 而非拯救他們自己
together to save the species instead of themselves.

1493
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:19,440
或是他們的孩子
Or their children.

1494
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:20,650
胡說
Bullshit.

1495
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:23,610
要不是你相信這樣做能救你的孩子 你絕對不會來這裡的
You never would've come unless you believed you would save them.

1496
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:26,990
人類的進化還沒能超越那個簡單的障礙
Evolution has yet to transcend that simple barrier.

1497
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:29,620
我們可以深沉而無私地
We can care deeply, selflessly about...

1498
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:31,010
關心自己的親人 但是
...those we know, but that

1499
01:43:31,010 --> 01:43:33,290
對於那些不認識的人 我們少有付出
empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight.

1500
01:43:33,450 --> 01:43:35,160
但那個謊言
But the lie.

1501
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:40,880
那個彌天大謊
That monstrous lie?

1502
01:43:42,130 --> 01:43:43,420
是不可原諒的
Unforgivable.

1503
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:45,050
他知道
And he knew that.

1504
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:47,370
他早就準備好了
He was prepared to destroy

1505
01:43:47,370 --> 01:43:50,140
為了拯救整個種群 甘願放棄自己的人性
his own humanity in order to save the species.

1506
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:52,720
- 他做出了極大的犧牲  - 不
- He made an incredible sacrifice. - No.

1507
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:56,140
做出極大犧牲的
An incredible sacrifice is being

1508
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:59,020
是那些在地球上等死的人
made by the people on Earth who are gonna die!

1509
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:01,650
因為他那該死的自負
Because in his fucking arrogance...

1510
01:44:02,070 --> 01:44:04,150
他將那些人判了死刑
...he declared their case hopeless.

1511
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:06,320
我很抱歉 Cooper
I'm sorry, Cooper...

1512
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:08,320
他們的確毫無希望
...their case is hopeless.

1513
01:44:08,490 --> 01:44:10,620
不 不是
No. No.

1514
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:12,740
我們才是人類的未來
We are the future.

1515
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:18,330
Cooper 我能做點什麼
Cooper, what can I do?

1516
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:23,380
讓我回家
Let me go home.

1517
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:25,880
你真的能確定嗎
You're absolutely positive?

1518
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:29,010
他的演算法沒錯 他好多年前就解出來了
His solution was correct. He'd had it for years.

1519
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,300
- 那沒用嗎  - 那只是一半的答案
- It's worthless? - It's half the answer.

1520
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:36,270
好吧 那你怎麼找到另一半
Okay, how do you find the other half?

1521
01:44:36,850 --> 01:44:38,520
在外太空 從黑洞裡找
Out there? A black hole.

1522
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:41,520
- 但是在地球上  - 怎麼
- But stuck down here on Earth? - Yeah?

1523
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,520
就沒法找到了
I'm not sure you can.

1524
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:49,110
天啊 他們都在收拾離開
God, they just pack up and leave.

1525
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:52,620
他們能撤離去哪兒呢
What are they hoping to find?

1526
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:54,240
生存
Survival.

1527
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:03,130
該死
Damn it.

1528
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:09,840
Murph 難道 難道人們就沒權利知道嗎
Murph, don't--? Don't people have a right to know?

1529
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:14,550
恐慌無濟於事 我們只要繼續工作 像往常一樣
Panic won't help. We just have to keep working, same as ever.

1530
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:16,030
但那不正是
But isn't that exactly what

1531
01:45:16,030 --> 01:45:18,060
Brand教授一直以來對我們的操縱嗎
Professor Brand was manipulating us to do?

1532
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:21,480
Brand放棄了我們 但是我仍在嘗試解決
Brand gave up on us. I'm still trying to solve this.

1533
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:23,190
那
So...

1534
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:26,270
你有主意了嗎
...do you have an idea?

1535
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:28,320
只是一種感覺
A feeling.

1536
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:33,740
我跟你講過我的幽靈
I told you about my ghost.

1537
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:37,790
我爸爸以為我稱它為幽靈
My dad thought I called it a ghost...

1538
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:39,910
是因為我怕它
...because I was scared of it.

1539
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,710
但是我從來沒害怕過它
But I was never scared of it.

1540
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:49,590
我稱它為幽靈是因為 我覺得
I called it a ghost because it felt...

1541
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:53,680
它很像一個人
It felt like a person.

1542
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:57,890
它一直在試圖告訴我些什麼
It was trying to tell me something.

1543
01:46:00,850 --> 01:46:03,850
如果地球上有解 一定藏在那裡
If there's an answer here on Earth, it's back there...

1544
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:06,230
在那間屋子裡
...somehow, in that room.

1545
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:08,530
所以我必須找到它
So I have to find it.

1546
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:13,700
我們快沒時間了
We're running out of time.

1547
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:17,620
那些備用的氧氣淨化器呢
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

1548
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:19,950
不 可以留下來 反正大部分的路程裡我都會休眠
No, they can stay. I'll be sleeping anyway.

1549
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:21,710
- 嘿 Coop  - 怎麼了
- Hey, Coop? - Yeah?

1550
01:46:21,870 --> 01:46:23,870
對於你的返程旅行我有個建議
I have a suggestion for your return journey.

1551
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:26,790
- 好吧 什麼建議  - 最後一次嘗試一下黑洞
- Yeah, what's that? - Have one last crack at the black hole.

1552
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:30,260
我要回家了 Rom
I'm going home, Rom.

1553
01:46:30,420 --> 01:46:33,680
是的 我知道 這又不花時間
Yeah, I know. This isn't going to cost you any time.

1554
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:36,260
對地球上的人也是一個機會
There's a chance for the people on Earth.

1555
01:46:37,010 --> 01:46:40,060
- 跟我說說  - 卡岡圖亞是個很古老的旋轉黑洞
- Talk to me. - Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

1556
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:44,100
- 就是我們所說的溫和奇點  - 溫和嗎
- It's what we call a gentle singularity. - Gentle?

1557
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:47,730
並不溫和 但是引力潮汐來得很快
They're hardly gentle. But the tidal gravity is so quick that...

1558
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:49,510
如果穿越的速度夠快
...something crossing the

1559
01:46:49,510 --> 01:46:52,150
或許能逃過一劫 比如探測器
horizon fast might survive. A probe, say.

1560
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,370
穿越後會怎樣
What happens after it crosses?

1561
01:46:54,370 --> 01:46:56,990
邊界另一邊是什麼樣 我們完全沒有概念
After the horizon is a complete mystery.

1562
01:46:57,160 --> 01:47:00,240
所以倒不如問 假如探測器看到了奇點
So, what's to say there isn't some way that the probe...

1563
01:47:00,410 --> 01:47:03,330
但是沒辦法把量子數據傳遞出來 該怎麼辦
...can glimpse the singularity and relay the quantum data?

1564
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:06,750
如果他配備了所需的裝置 可以發射任何一種脈衝能量
If he's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse.

1565
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:09,710
教授 什麼時候這個探測器成了"他"了
Just when did this probe become a "He," Professor?

1566
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:12,010
很明顯TARS就是一個候選
TARS is the obvious candidate.

1567
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:14,760
我已經告訴他該怎麼做了
I've already told him what to look for.

1568
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:17,640
我需要KIPP身上的舊光學發射器 Cooper
I'd need the old optical transmitter off KIPP, Cooper.

1569
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,140
你要替我們去
You'd do this for us?

1570
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:20,530
在你熱淚盈眶前
Before you get all teary,

1571
01:47:20,530 --> 01:47:23,220
先試著提醒自己 作為機器人 我必須遵守你的任何指令
remember that as a robot I have to do anything you say.

1572
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:25,600
你的指示燈壞了
Your cue light's broken.

1573
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:27,310
我不是在開玩笑
I'm not joking.

1574
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:33,190
我需要TARS從KIPP身上取點零件安上
I'll need TARS to remove and adapt some components from KIPP.

1575
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:35,700
好吧 但不要損壞他的資訊管理系統
I don't want to disturb his archival functions.

1576
01:47:35,860 --> 01:47:37,360
我會看著他的
I'll supervise.

1577
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:38,740
好的
All right.

1578
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:41,470
Mann博士 我們得找三個安全基地
Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure sites.

1579
01:47:41,470 --> 01:47:43,580
一個用作Brand的實驗室 另外兩個用做棲居地
One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.

1580
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:46,210
一旦那些飛船著陸後 就不好再做移動了
Once those modules have landed, you don't want to move them.

1581
01:47:46,370 --> 01:47:48,920
好吧 我可以帶你去那些探測地點 但我覺得
I can take you to the probe sites, but I don't think...

1582
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,800
那裡的條件可能不穩定 我想我們應該再等等
...these conditions will hold. I think we should wait.

1583
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:54,800
CASE已經帶著剩下的蒸餾淨水器過來了
CASE is headed down with the rest of the distillery equipment.

1584
01:47:54,970 --> 01:47:57,800
我希望在天黑之前把營地建好
I'd really like to secure those sites by nightfall.

1585
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:02,810
好吧 指不定什麼時候就刮暴風了
Well, these squalls do usually blow over.

1586
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:04,350
沒問題
Okay, then.

1587
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,730
- 你得有遠距離傳輸器  - 有呢
- You'll need a long-range transmitter. - Got it.

1588
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:08,440
- 充滿電了嗎  - 是的
- Are you charged? - Yeah.

1589
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:10,060
跟我來
Follow me.

1590
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:13,020
TARS 72個小時 記住了
TARS, 72 hours, yeah?

1591
01:48:13,190 --> 01:48:14,400
收到 明白 Cooper
Roger that, Cooper.

1592
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:23,740
Brand告訴了我你為什麼得回去
Brand told me why you feel you have to go back.

1593
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:28,330
但是出於職責 我還是想說
But I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention...

1594
01:48:28,670 --> 01:48:30,200
像咱們這樣的任務
...that a mission such as

1595
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,840
多一個工程師 就多了一份保障
ours could certainly use an extra engineer.

1596
01:48:34,670 --> 01:48:38,930
你最好開慢點 小子 安全第一 CASE 記住
You better slow down, turbo. Safety first, CASE, remember.

1597
01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:41,300
安全第一 Cooper
Safety first, Cooper.

1598
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:45,560
Mann博士 我想告訴你我真的很榮幸能參與其中
I have to tell you, Dr. Mann, I'm honored to be a part of this.

1599
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:47,830
但是一旦咱們建好了營地
But once we set up base camp

1600
01:48:47,830 --> 01:48:50,940
確保飛船安全 我的任務就完成了
and secure those modules, my work's done here.

1601
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:52,690
我就要回家了
I'm going home.

1602
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:04,200
你心中有牽掛 但即使沒有家庭
You have attachments. But even without a family...

1603
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:06,400
我敢保證
...I can promise you that that

1604
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:09,080
那種對陪伴的渴望也會很強烈
yearning to be with other people is powerful.

1605
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:13,080
正是那種根生蒂固的情感
That emotion is at the foundation...

1606
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:16,800
讓我們之所以為人 這並不易被掠去
...of what makes us human. It's not to be taken lightly.

1607
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,390
- 你咳了多久了  - 有一段時間了
- How long have you had that cough? - A while.

1608
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:39,860
媽媽讓我在這兒玩
Mom lets me play in here.

1609
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:43,030
我不會亂碰你的東西
I don't touch your stuff.

1610
01:49:41,862 --> 01:49:43,142
墨菲的收納盒

1611
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:15,650
動作最好輕點
Just take this gently.

1612
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:21,900
你知道為什麼我們
You know why we couldn't

1613
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:24,160
不直接派機器來完成這些任務嗎
just send machines on these missions, don't you?

1614
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:26,470
因為機器不能隨機應變
A machine doesn't improvise

1615
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:29,410
因為你不能把對死亡的恐懼設置到他們的程式裡
well because you can't program a fear of death.

1616
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:32,620
我們的生存本能往往使我們
Our survival instinct is our single greatest...

1617
01:50:32,790 --> 01:50:36,330
絕處逢生 以你為例
...source of inspiration. Take you, for example.

1618
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:38,380
作為父親
A father...

1619
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,880
你的生存渴望延伸到你的孩子身上
...with a survival instinct that extends to your kids.

1620
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:44,760
你知道根據科學研究
What does research tell us is

1621
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:47,720
人在臨死前看到的最後畫面是什麼嗎
the last thing you're going to see before you die?

1622
01:50:49,430 --> 01:50:51,890
是孩子 是他們的臉
Your children. Their faces.

1623
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:54,810
在死亡的瞬間 你的意識會更強烈地
At the moment of death, your mind's gonna push...

1624
01:50:54,980 --> 01:50:56,690
刺激你掙扎求生
...A little bit harder to survive.

1625
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:58,440
為了他們
For them.

1626
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,570
深呼吸
Deep breath.

1627
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:04,420
嘿 我猜你是Coop
Uh, hey. I bet you're Coop.

1628
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:06,610
你能坐這兒等一會兒嗎
Why don't you have a seat here for me?

1629
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:09,240
很糟糕 他們得離開這兒
It's bad. They cannot stay here.

1630
01:51:09,950 --> 01:51:11,240
- 明白嗎  - 好的
- Okay? - Yeah.

1631
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,050
TARS 怎麼這麼久
TARS, what's taking so long?

1632
01:51:21,210 --> 01:51:24,090
教授 我遇到了點麻煩 沒法兒完成初始化
Professor, I am having trouble completing the boot up.

1633
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:25,800
我不明白
I don't understand.

1634
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:33,850
這挺可笑的
It's funny.

1635
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:37,560
當我離開地球的時候
When I left Earth...

1636
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:40,650
我覺得自己已經做好了死的準備
...I thought I was prepared to die.

1637
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:44,030
但事實是
The truth is...

1638
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:48,130
我從沒認真考慮過
...I never really considered

1639
01:51:48,130 --> 01:51:51,240
我的星球不適合居住的可能性
the possibility that my planet wasn't the one.

1640
01:51:53,950 --> 01:51:56,290
結果和當初的預想完全不同
Nothing worked out the way it was supposed to.

1641
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:57,500
咱們走吧
Let's go.

1642
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:08,760
嘿 小朋友 我們現在做個深呼吸
All right, buddy, give me a big deep breath.

1643
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:14,970
什麼情況
What is this?

1644
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:17,200
- 你在幹什麼  - 對不起
- What are you doing? - I'm sorry!

1645
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:19,230
我不能讓你開走那艘飛船
I can't let you leave with that ship.

1646
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:21,900
我需要它來完成這個計畫
We're gonna need it to complete the mission...

1647
01:52:22,230 --> 01:52:25,650
一旦其他人意識到這個星球並不像我說的那樣
...once the others realize what this place isn't.

1648
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:28,700
我們都活不了 對不起
We cannot survive here. I'm sorry!

1649
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:30,200
我很抱歉
I'm sorry!

1650
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:43,090
他們不能再待在這兒了 你得趕緊離開
They can't stay here anymore. You have to leave right now.

1651
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:45,350
讓我把事情挑明瞭吧
Let me make something abundantly clear.

1652
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:46,800
你肩負著責任呢
You have a responsibility--

1653
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:50,090
- 該死  - Coop 幫她拿行李 她要回去了
- Oh! Jesus! - Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.

1654
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:52,350
爸爸可沒把你養成現在這副蠢樣 Tom
Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb, Tom!

1655
01:52:52,510 --> 01:52:54,260
養我的可不是爸爸 是外公
Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did.

1656
01:52:54,260 --> 01:52:56,600
他就在後面 埋在媽媽和Jesse旁邊
And he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.

1657
01:52:57,180 --> 01:52:59,850
所有的資料都是你編的嗎
You faked all the data?

1658
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:02,650
是的
Yeah.

1659
01:53:06,650 --> 01:53:08,360
根本就沒有含氧氣的地下層嗎
There's no surface?

1660
01:53:08,530 --> 01:53:09,700
沒有
No.

1661
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:12,660
我也試過盡職盡責
I tried to do my duty, Cooper...

1662
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:14,710
但我第一天到這裡的時候
...but I knew the day that

1663
01:53:14,710 --> 01:53:17,830
就知道這個地方毫無希望
I arrived here that this place had nothing.

1664
01:53:18,450 --> 01:53:22,250
在好幾年裡 我努力克制
And I resisted the temptation for years...

1665
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,960
但是我也知道
...but I knew that...

1666
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:28,130
只需按下那個按鈕
...if I just pressed that button, then...

1667
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:30,430
就一定會有人來救我
...somebody would come and save me.

1668
01:53:31,470 --> 01:53:32,970
你這個該死的懦夫
You fucking coward.

1669
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:34,850
是啊
Yes.

1670
01:53:40,270 --> 01:53:41,310
是啊
Yes.

1671
01:53:43,230 --> 01:53:44,270
是啊
Yes.

1672
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,570
是啊
Yes.

1673
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:00,110
聽著 如果你不想走
Listen, if you're not going to go,

1674
01:54:00,110 --> 01:54:02,620
那就讓你的家人走 放他們一條生路
let your family go. Just save your family.

1675
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:05,420
然後和你去地下生活嗎
And we go live underground with you?

1676
01:54:05,590 --> 01:54:07,500
和你一起祈禱爸爸回來救咱們嗎
Pray that Daddy comes to save us?

1677
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:11,170
爸爸不會回來了 他根本就沒打算回來 現在這一切都得靠我
Dad's not coming back. He never was coming back. It's up to me.

1678
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:13,220
你能拯救每個人嗎
You're gonna save everybody?

1679
01:54:13,590 --> 01:54:16,430
- 就因為爸爸不能嗎  - 爸爸根本就沒試過
- Because Dad couldn't do it. - Dad didn't even try!

1680
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:18,770
他拋棄了我們
Dad just abandoned us!

1681
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,310
他把我們留在這兒等死
He left us here to die.

1682
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:23,690
他們不會跟你走的
Nobody's going with you.

1683
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:30,110
那你就等著再失去一個孩子吧
You gonna wait for your next kid to die?

1684
01:54:33,110 --> 01:54:34,410
滾出去
Get out.

1685
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,620
別再回來了
And don't come back.

1686
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,330
那些都留給你了
You can keep my stuff.

1687
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:55,640
停手
Stop it!

1688
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:00,220
不 不
No. No!

1689
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:04,190
Mann博士 你有百分之五十的幾率會弄死你自己
Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance you're gonna kill yourself!

1690
01:55:05,020 --> 01:55:07,020
這是我這些年裡遇到的最好的幾率了
Those are the best odds I've had in years.

1691
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:29,290
別指責我 Cooper
Don't judge me, Cooper.

1692
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:32,300
你從沒經受過我這樣的考驗
You were never tested like I was.

1693
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:34,380
沒人體驗過
Few men have been.

1694
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,890
你已經盡力了 Murph
You tried your best, Murph.

1695
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:54,780
你感覺到了 對嗎
You're feeling it, aren't you?

1696
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:58,280
求生的本能
The survival instinct.

1697
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:01,890
正是它一直驅使著我 它驅使著每個人
That's what drove me. It's what drives all of us.

1698
01:56:01,890 --> 01:56:03,540
它也將拯救我們
And it's what's gonna save us.

1699
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:08,040
因為我想救所有的人 為了你 Cooper
Because I want to save all of us. For you, Cooper.

1700
01:56:13,210 --> 01:56:16,760
對不起 我不能 我不能看著你遭受這一切 對不起
I'm sorry, I can't watch you go through this. I'm sorry.

1701
01:56:17,090 --> 01:56:19,760
我以為我可以 但是我不行
I thought I could, but I can't.

1702
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:23,010
我在這兒陪著你
I'm here. I'm here for you.

1703
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:25,350
聽著我的聲音 Cooper 我在這兒
Just listen to my voice, Cooper.

1704
01:56:26,140 --> 01:56:27,480
我在這兒
I'm right here.

1705
01:56:29,310 --> 01:56:30,650
你不是一個人
You're not alone.

1706
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:41,870
你看見你的孩子們了嗎
Do you see your children?

1707
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:46,450
沒事的
It's okay.

1708
01:56:47,410 --> 01:56:49,170
他們在那兒等著你呢
They are right there with you.

1709
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:55,630
出發前Brand教授給你讀那首詩了嗎
Did Professor Brand tell you that poem before you left?

1710
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:57,970
你還記得嗎
Do you remember?

1711
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:03,010
不要溫順地走入那長夜
Do not go gentle into that good night

1712
01:57:04,930 --> 01:57:07,730
白日將盡
Old age should burn and rave

1713
01:57:07,890 --> 01:57:09,480
暮年仍應燃燒咆哮
At close of day

1714
01:57:11,060 --> 01:57:13,440
怒斥吧 怒斥那光明漸逝
Rage, rage against the dying of the light

1715

1775
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:49,840
忽略
Override.

1776
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:52,210
您無此許可權
Unauthorized.

1777
02:03:56,340 --> 02:03:58,290
不要嘗試對接 重複一遍
Do not attempt docking. I repeat,

1778
02:03:58,290 --> 02:04:00,470
不要嘗試對接 請回
do not attempt docking. Please resp--

1779
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:46,430
慢慢向永恆號靠近
Moving slowly toward the Endurance.

1780
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:12,540
對接不完全
Imperfect contact.

1781
02:05:12,710 --> 02:05:14,750
- 忽略  - 艙門已鎖定
- Override. - Hatch lockout.

1782
02:05:22,550 --> 02:05:25,100
- 他對接上了嗎  - 還沒全對上
- ls he locked on yet? - imperfectly.

1783
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:28,180
Mann博士 不要
Dr. Mann, do not--

1784
02:05:49,660 --> 02:05:52,670
艙門鎖定已解除
Hatch lockout disengaged.

1785
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:04,720
Mann博士 再重複一遍 不要打開艙門
Dr. Mann, do not, I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1786
02:06:05,050 --> 02:06:06,930
再重複一遍 不要打開艙門
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1787
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:09,930
如果艙門打開了 氣密艙會失去壓力
If you open the hatch, the airlock will depressurize.

1788
02:06:35,830 --> 02:06:38,130
- 如果他強行打開會怎樣  - 沒好事
- What happens if he blows the airlock? -  Nothing good.

1789
02:06:44,010 --> 02:06:46,640
好 往後退 快往後退 CASE 馬上後退
Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters, everything we've got, CASE!

1790
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:48,510
- 已經全速後退  - 往後退
- Thrusters are full! - Back!

1791
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:50,680
CASE 讓我連接到機艙的電腦
CASE, Relay my transmission to the onboard computer...

1792
02:06:50,850 --> 02:06:52,940
並將我的話以緊急廣播的形式重複播送
...and have it rebroadcast as emergency P.A.

1793
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:54,140
Mann博士
Dr. Mann--

1794
02:06:56,730 --> 02:06:59,610
重複一遍 不要打開內艙門 重複一遍
I repeat, do not open the inner hatch. I repeat--

1795
02:06:59,780 --> 02:07:00,820
Brand嗎
Brand?

1796
02:07:01,650 --> 02:07:03,700
不管他是怎麼跟你說的
I don't know what he said to you...

1797
02:07:03,860 --> 02:07:06,530
現在我要掌控永恆號了
...but I am taking command of the Endurance.

1798
02:07:06,990 --> 02:07:09,030
然後我們再談完成任務的事情
And then we can talk about completing the mission.

1799
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:14,210
Mann博士 聽我說
Dr. Mann, listen to me.

1800
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
這不是關於我的性命
This is not about my life.

1801
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:20,880
或是Cooper的性命 而是全人類的性命
Or Cooper's life. This is about all mankind.

1802
02:07:21,460 --> 02:07:22,880
總有一天
There is a moment--

1803
02:07:29,220 --> 02:07:30,560
這不
lt is not sa--

1804
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:39,900
噢 天哪
Oh, my God.

1805
02:07:58,210 --> 02:07:59,490
Cooper 不要再把燃料
Cooper, there's no point using

1806
02:07:59,490 --> 02:08:02,170
- 浪費在追逐上  - 給我分析永恆號的旋轉情況
- fuel to chase-- - Analyze the Endurance's spin.

1807
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:09,640
- Cooper 你在幹什麼  - 對接
- Cooper, what are you doing? -Docking.

1808
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:17,060
永恆號的轉速是每分鐘67 68轉
Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.

1809
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:19,690
好 準備好用反向推進器和它同步旋轉
Okay, get ready to match our spin with the retro thrusters.

1810
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:21,940
- 你不可能做到的  - 不
- It's not possible. - No...

1811
02:08:22,110 --> 02:08:23,280
我必須做到
...it's necessary.

1812
02:08:34,910 --> 02:08:37,080
永恆號已經進入平流層
Endurance is hitting stratosphere!

1813
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:43,170
永恆號沒有隔熱板
She's got no heat shield.

1814
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:48,050
- CASE 準備好了嗎  - 準備好了
- CASE, you ready? - Ready.

1815
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:59,650
Cooper 沒時間安全第一了
Cooper! This is no time for caution.

1816
02:09:01,190 --> 02:09:03,650
CASE 我要是暈過去了 就由你來接管
CASE, if I black out, you take the stick.

1817
02:09:03,820 --> 02:09:06,280
TARS 準備啟動對接裝置
TARS, get ready to engage the docking mechanism.

1818
02:09:13,330 --> 02:09:14,830
永恆號已經開始升溫了
Endurance is starting to heat.

1819
02:09:14,990 --> 02:09:16,330
還有20尺
Twenty feet out.

1820
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:19,000
向右舷傾斜3度  Cooper
I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.

1821
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:21,170
還有10尺
Ten feet out.

1822
02:09:21,330 --> 02:09:23,840
Cooper 我們已經對齊了
Cooper, we are lined up.

1823
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,590
開始旋轉
Initiating spin!

1824
02:10:07,170 --> 02:10:08,380
加油 TARS
Come on, TARS.

1825
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:18,180
加油 TARS
Come on, TARS!

1826
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:31,820
- Cooper 我們對接成功了  - 降低速度
- We are locked, Cooper. - Locked. Easing up!

1827
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:41,040
慢點
Easy.

1828
02:10:42,210 --> 02:10:43,540
慢點
Easy.

1829
02:10:49,380 --> 02:10:50,880
反向推進器
Retro thrusters!

1830
02:10:58,850 --> 02:11:00,350
啟動主引擎
Main engines on.

1831
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:08,820
飛船已經離開軌道了 來吧 寶貝
Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.

1832
02:11:16,820 --> 02:11:18,490
關閉主引擎
Killing main engines!

1833
02:11:19,740 --> 02:11:21,410
好了 我們已經離開軌道了
Okay, we're out of orbit.

1834
02:11:28,750 --> 02:11:31,630
好了 請期待下一個表演項目
Okay. And for our next trick!

1835
02:11:33,470 --> 02:11:37,300
最好別演砸了 我們正進入卡岡圖亞的引力範圍
It'll have to be good. We're heading into Gargantua's pull.

1836
02:11:38,220 --> 02:11:39,260
哦 糟糕
Oh, shit.

1837
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:41,560
- CASE 你來操作  - 好的
- CASE, take the stick. - Roger that.

1838
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:33,860
Cooper 我們正在向卡岡圖亞滑去
Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.

1839
02:12:35,190 --> 02:12:37,150
我是否該開啟主引擎
Shall I use main engines?

1840
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:38,360
不
No.

1841
02:12:38,950 --> 02:12:41,200
我們要讓飛船儘量保持滑行
We got to let her slide as far as we can.

1842
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,880
- 說吧  - Cooper 我有好消息也有壞消息
- Give it to me. - There's good news, there's bad news.

1843
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:56,670
這話我聽過了 TARS  有話直說吧
Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS. Give it to me straight.

1844
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:06,900
備用發電機已經啟動
The backup generator kicked in,

1845
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:08,730
系統可以穩定運行了 一切順利
so the system's stable. They're all good.

1846
02:13:08,890 --> 02:13:09,940
太好了
Good.

1847
02:13:10,350 --> 02:13:13,690
好了 導航器已經被完全摧毀了
Okay. The navigational hub has been completely destroyed.

1848
02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:16,820
我們的物資已經不夠我們回到地球了
We don't have enough life support to make it back to Earth...

1849
02:13:16,990 --> 02:13:19,070
但我覺得我們可以撐到Edmunds的星球
...but we can scratch our way to Edmunds' planet.

1850
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:20,570
燃料怎麼辦
What about fuel?

1851
02:13:20,990 --> 02:13:23,490
不夠 但我有個計畫
Not enough. But I have a plan.

1852
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:28,120
讓卡岡圖亞把我們拉向它的邊界
We let Gargantua pull us down close to her horizon.

1853
02:13:28,620 --> 02:13:30,130
用引力彈弓效應
Then a powered slingshot around,

1854
02:13:30,130 --> 02:13:31,880
把我們射向Edmunds的星球
launching us towards Edmunds' planet.

1855
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:34,540
- 手動操作嗎  - 這就是選我的原因
- Manually? - That's what I'm here for.

1856
02:13:34,710 --> 02:13:37,420
我會讓咱們準確地駛入臨界軌道
I'm gonna take us just inside the critical orbit.

1857
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:40,090
- 那時間畸變呢  - 現在不是考慮
- What about time slippage? - Neither of us has time to worry...

1858
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:41,930
相對論的時候 Brand博士
...about relativity right now, Dr. Brand.

1859
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,060
抱歉 Cooper
I'm sorry, Cooper.

1860
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:54,440
只要我們在卡岡圖亞周圍獲得了足夠的速度
Once we've gathered enough speed around Gargantua...

1861
02:13:54,770 --> 02:13:56,610
我們就把登陸艙1號
...we use Lander 1...

1862
02:14:00,570 --> 02:14:02,570
將我們推離黑洞的引力
...push us out of the black hole's gravity.

1863
02:14:04,910 --> 02:14:07,580
登陸艙的聯動裝置已經被毀了
The Lander's linkages have been destroyed...

1864
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:10,080
所以我們必須要手動操作它
...so we'll have to control manually.

1865
02:14:11,290 --> 02:14:14,750
一旦登陸艙一號的燃料耗盡 TARS就會操作分離
Once Lander 1 is spent, TARS will detach--

1866
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:16,630
然後被黑洞一下子吸進去
And get sucked into that black hole.

1867
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:19,210
為什麼非要讓TARS分離
Why does TARS have to detach?

1868
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:21,420
我們不得不甩掉一些重量 才能擺脫引力
We have to shed the weight to escape the gravity.

1869
02:14:21,590 --> 02:14:22,970
牛頓第三定律
Newton's third law.

1870
02:14:23,130 --> 02:14:25,850
人類所知道的 到達一個地方的唯一方法
The only way humans have ever figured out of getting somewhere...

1871
02:14:26,010 --> 02:14:27,560
就是拋棄一些東西
...is to leave something behind.

1872
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:30,770
Cooper 你不能要求TARS這麼做
Cooper, you can't ask TARS to do this for us.

1873
02:14:30,930 --> 02:14:34,770
他是個機器人 所以你不需要刻意要求他
He's a robot. So you don't have to ask him to do anything.

1874
02:14:34,940 --> 02:14:36,230
Cooper 你個混蛋
Cooper, you asshole!

1875
02:14:36,610 --> 02:14:38,610
抱歉 要讓你受委屈了
Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.

1876
02:14:38,860 --> 02:14:41,110
這就是我們的使命 Brand博士
It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.

1877
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:43,910
這是我們拯救地球上的人類的唯一機會
It's our only chance to save people on Earth.

1878
02:14:44,070 --> 02:14:45,100
如果我能想辦法
If I can find a way to

1879
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:47,280
把那兒的量子資料傳輸出去
transmit the quantum data I'll find in there...

1880
02:14:47,450 --> 02:14:49,290
那他們說不定還能活下去
...they might still make it.

1881
02:14:50,330 --> 02:14:52,960
但願還有人能撐到那個時候
Let's just hope there's still someone there to save.

1882
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:23,110
已達到最大速度
Maximum velocity achieved.

1883
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:26,870
準備加速脫離軌道
Prepare to fire escape thrusters.

1884
02:15:27,030 --> 02:15:28,120
準備好了嗎
Ready?

1885
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:29,700
準備完畢
Ready.

1886
02:15:29,870 --> 02:15:31,040
準備完畢
Ready.

1887
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:33,000
主引擎點火倒計時 三
Main engine ignition in three...

1888
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:34,330

...two...

1889
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:36,790
一 啟動
...one. Mark.

1890
02:15:50,220 --> 02:15:51,470
加油啊 寶貝兒
Come on, baby.

1891
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:54,810
登陸艙1號 聽我指示
Lander 1 engines, on my mark.

1892
02:15:55,140 --> 02:15:56,190

Three, two, one...

1897
02:16:10,410 --> 02:16:11,580
- 啟動  - 點火
- Mark. - Fire!

1898
02:16:21,710 --> 02:16:24,880
這點小事花了我們五十一年
This little maneuver's gonna cost us 51 years!

1899
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:28,260
你聽著也不像快一百二的人啊
You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!

1900
02:16:38,362 --> 02:16:40,462
一號登陸艙 燃料即將耗盡

1901
02:16:43,650 --> 02:16:46,820
登陸艙1號 準備分離 聽我指揮
Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.

1902
02:16:47,490 --> 02:16:49,490
三 二
Three, two...

1903
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:52,700
一 開始
...one. Mark.

1904
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:53,950
分離
Detach!

1905
02:16:57,120 --> 02:16:59,620
- 再見了 TARS  - 再見 Brand博士
- Goodbye, TARS. - Goodbye, Dr. Brand.

1906
02:16:59,790 --> 02:17:02,790
- 那頭見啦 Coop  - 那頭見啦 小子
- See you on the other side, Coop. - See you there, Slick!

1907
02:17:05,562 --> 02:17:07,662
徘徊者二號 燃料即將耗盡

1908
02:17:11,300 --> 02:17:12,890
不錯 CASE
Okay, CASE.

1909
02:17:13,930 --> 02:17:17,310
- 飛得有驚無險  - 還不是師父教導有方
- Nice reckless flying! - Learned from the master.

1910
02:17:17,770 --> 02:17:20,350
- 漫遊者2號 準備分離  - 什麼
- Ranger 2, prepare to detach. - What?

1911
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:23,440
不 不 Cooper Cooper你在幹什麼
No! No! Cooper! What are you doing?

1912
02:17:23,900 --> 02:17:27,610
牛頓第三定律 你總得扔下點什麼
Newton's third law. You got to leave something behind.

1913
02:17:27,780 --> 02:17:30,200
你明明說了這些資源夠兩個人用
You told me we had enough resources for both of us.

1914
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:32,120
我們說好的 Amelia
We agreed, Amelia...

1915
02:17:32,490 --> 02:17:33,950
90%誠實
...90 percent.

1916
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:36,910
不要
Don't.

1917
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:40,290
分離
Detach.

1918
02:17:53,390 --> 02:17:56,140
好了 我們正在俯衝
Okay, I am nosing down.

1919
02:17:59,930 --> 02:18:01,940
即將到達黑洞邊界
Approaching the event horizon.

1920
02:18:04,190 --> 02:18:06,440
左舷已經接觸到邊界
Portside, dipping down beneath it...

1921
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:08,690
馬上就要穿過去了
...to go through it.

1922
02:18:10,280 --> 02:18:13,110
正在靠近黑暗
Heading towards blackness.

1923
02:18:13,450 --> 02:18:15,450
我能看見一點
I have a visual of the event.

1924
02:18:15,950 --> 02:18:17,330
一片黑暗
It's all black.

1925
02:18:19,450 --> 02:18:21,120
TARS 聽得到嗎
TARS, do you read me?

1926
02:18:21,460 --> 02:18:22,960
周圍全是黑的
It's all blackness.

1927
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:26,960
TARS 你聽得見嗎 完畢
TARS! Do you read me? Over.

1928
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:32,970
好吧
Okay.

1929
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:35,430
螢幕
Screens...

1930
02:18:37,060 --> 02:18:38,560
開始受到干擾
...getting interference.

1931
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:42,850
控制杆已經失靈 這裡有閃光
Losing control of the stick. I got flashes.

1932
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:45,610
黑暗中有白色閃光
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

1933
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:49,320
引力開始波動 波動幅度變大
The turbulence in the gravity is increasing.

1934
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:55,490
啊
Ah.

1935
02:18:55,990 --> 02:18:58,830
電腦已經癱瘓
The computers are going down. Agh.

1936
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:12,760
是引力的作用 操縱杆已經失靈了
Gravitational pull. I'm losing control of the stick.

1937
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:47,790
Murph Murph 快走吧
Murph? Murph, come on!

1938
02:19:53,460 --> 02:19:55,470

What's it say? What's it say, Murph?

1968
02:24:36,120 --> 02:24:37,210
它說了什麼
What's it say?

1969
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:48,890
"留下"
"Stay.

1970
02:25:24,630 --> 02:25:26,090
告訴他 Murph
Tell him, Murph.

1971
02:25:26,260 --> 02:25:27,470
讓他留下來
Make him stay.

1972
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:32,470
讓他留下來 Murph
Make him stay, Murph.

1973
02:25:36,562 --> 02:25:40,462
留下

1974
02:25:41,480 --> 02:25:43,360
讓他留下來 Murph
Make him stay, Murph.

1975
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:46,940

02:25:58,370 --> 02:26:00,710
不 不 不
No!No!No!

1978
02:26:21,390 --> 02:26:22,900
那是你
It was you.

1979
02:26:34,370 --> 02:26:36,410
你就是我的幽靈
You were my ghost.

1980
02:26:46,130 --> 02:26:49,130
Cooper Cooper 聽得見嗎 Cooper
Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.

1981
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:53,430
- TARS  - 收到
- TARS? - Roger that.

1982
02:26:55,220 --> 02:26:57,850
- 你還在  - 我在
- You survived. - Somewhere...

1983
02:26:58,390 --> 02:27:00,430
他們五維空間的某處
...in their fifth dimension.

1984
02:27:00,600 --> 02:27:02,940
他們救了我們
They saved us.

1985
02:27:03,100 --> 02:27:05,260
是嗎 他們是什麼玩意
Yeah? Who the hell is "They"?

1986
02:27:05,260 --> 02:27:08,320
他們又為什麼肯幫我們
And just why would they want to help us'?

1987
02:27:08,480 --> 02:27:09,400
我不清楚 但是他們
I don't know, but they

1988
02:27:09,400 --> 02:27:11,190
在五維空間裡
constructed this three-dimensional space...

1989
02:27:11,360 --> 02:27:12,870
建立了這個三維空間
...inside their five-dimensional reality

1990
02:27:12,870 --> 02:27:14,660
好讓你明白該怎麼辦
to allow you to understand it.

1991
02:27:14,820 --> 02:27:16,780
可這一點用也沒有
Yeah, that ain't working.

1992
02:27:16,950 --> 02:27:18,490
當然有用
Yes, it is.

1993
02:27:18,660 --> 02:27:20,090
你看到了時間
You've seen that time is

1994
02:27:20,090 --> 02:27:22,540
是以實體方式存在的
represented here as a physical dimension.

1995
02:27:22,710 --> 02:27:25,540
你也知道了有種力能跨越時空
You have worked out that you can exert a force across space-time.

1996
02:27:26,210 --> 02:27:29,380
引力 用來發送消息嗎
Gravity to send a message.

1997
02:27:29,750 --> 02:27:31,090
是的
Affirmative.

1998
02:27:33,670 --> 02:27:34,800
引力
Gravity...

1999
02:27:35,930 --> 02:27:39,260
可以穿越包括時間在內的維度嗎
...can cross the dimensions, including time.

2000
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:40,890
顯然如此
Apparently.

2001
02:27:44,770 --> 02:27:46,770
你有量子數據嗎
Do you have the quantum data?

2002
02:27:47,190 --> 02:27:48,810
收到 我有
Roger. I have it.

2003
02:27:49,770 --> 02:27:51,910
我試過了所有的波段
I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,

2004
02:27:51,910 --> 02:27:53,780
但什麼也沒傳出去 Cooper
but nothing is getting out, Cooper.

2005
02:27:53,940 --> 02:27:56,200
我能做到的 我能
I can do this. I can do this.

2006
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:59,410
一個孩子能看懂這麼複雜的資料嗎
But such complicated data to a child?

2007
02:27:59,580 --> 02:28:00,700
她可不是普通的孩子
Not just any child.

2008
02:28:00,870 --> 02:28:02,240
還有什麼
What else?

2009
02:28:02,790 --> 02:28:04,960
拜託 爸爸
Oh, come on, Dad.

2010
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:09,290
Murph 火已經熄滅了 快走啊
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

2011
02:28:09,460 --> 02:28:11,020
就算你在這裡把資料發了出去
Even if you communicate it here,

2012
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:13,460
她也要在好多年以後才能明白
she won't understand its significance for years.

2013
02:28:14,260 --> 02:28:15,720
這我清楚 TARS
I get that, TARS.

2014
02:28:15,880 --> 02:28:17,790
但我們必須要想出個辦法呀
But we've got to figure something out

2015
02:28:17,790 --> 02:28:20,550
否則地球上的人就死定了 想辦法
or the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!

2016
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:22,310
Cooper
Cooper...

2017
02:28:22,470 --> 02:28:24,980
他們不是讓我們來改寫歷史的
...they didn't bring us here to change the past.

2018
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:30,060
再說一遍
Say that again.

2019
02:28:30,230 --> 02:28:33,690
他們不是讓我們來改寫歷史的
They didn't bring us hereto change the past.

2020
02:28:38,110 --> 02:28:40,070
不 根本不是他們讓我們過來的
No, they didn't bring us here at all.

2021
02:28:44,700 --> 02:28:46,370
是我們自己
We brought ourselves.

2022
02:28:55,630 --> 02:28:59,680
TARS 給我NASA的二進位座標
TARS, give me the coordinates for NASA in binary.

2023
02:29:00,220 --> 02:29:02,680
二進位座標 好的 正在轉換資料
In binary. Roger. Feeding data.

2024
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,910
那不是幽靈
"It's not a ghost."

2025
02:29:30,670 --> 02:29:32,170
那是引力
"It's gravity."

2026
02:29:32,500 --> 02:29:34,170
你還沒明白嗎 TARS
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

2027
02:29:34,840 --> 02:29:36,630
是我把自己帶到了這裡
I brought myself here!

2028
02:29:37,510 --> 02:29:41,010
我們是來和三維空間交流的
We're here to communicate with the three-dimensional world.

2029
02:29:41,430 --> 02:29:42,930
我們就是橋樑
We're the bridge!

2030
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:52,730
我以為他們選擇的是我
I thought they chose me.

2031
02:29:56,070 --> 02:29:57,600
但他們選的不是我
But they didn't choose me,

2032
02:29:57,600 --> 02:29:59,740
- 而是她  - 選她幹什麼 Cooper
- they chose her. - For what, Cooper?

2033
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:03,910
選她去拯救世界
To save the world.

2034
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:12,580
全部的這些 都在這一個小女孩的臥室裡 每一個時刻
All of this is one little girl's bedroom. Every moment.

2035
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:14,340
這是極其複雜的
It's infinitely complex.

2036
02:30:14,500 --> 02:30:17,180
他們能通往無盡的時間和空間
They have access to infinite time and space,

2037
02:30:17,180 --> 02:30:19,260
但他們與現在沒有任何聯繫
but they're not bound by anything!

2038
02:30:19,420 --> 02:30:24,090
他們找不到正確的時間和地點 他們就無法交流
They can't find a specific place in time. They can't communicate.

2039
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:28,600
所以我才來到了這裡 我要找個辦法告訴Murph
That's why I'm here. I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...

2040
02:30:28,770 --> 02:30:30,270
就像我找到了這個時刻一樣
...just like I found this moment.

2041
02:30:30,430 --> 02:30:32,770
- 怎麼找呢 Cooper  - 愛呀 TARS 用愛
- How, Cooper? - Love, TARS, love.

2042
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:35,640
就像Brand說的 我與Murph的聯繫
It's just like Brand said. My connection with Murph,

2043
02:30:35,640 --> 02:30:37,360
是可以量化的 這關係就是關鍵
it is quantifiable. It's the key!

2044
02:30:37,530 --> 02:30:39,400
那我們來這裡幹什麼
What are we here to do?

2045
02:30:40,320 --> 02:30:42,200
找辦法告訴她
Find how to tell her.

2046
02:30:44,990 --> 02:30:46,330
那塊表
The watch.

2047
02:30:49,450 --> 02:30:50,620
那塊表
The watch.

2048
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,120
就是它
That's it.

2049
02:30:55,630 --> 02:30:58,630
我們可以把資料轉化成秒針的運動
We code the data into the movement of the second hand.

2050
02:31:02,260 --> 02:31:05,470
TARS 把資料轉化成摩爾斯電碼告訴我
TARS, translate the data into Morse and feed it to me.

2051
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:07,250
正在轉化成摩爾斯電碼
Translating data to Morse.

2052
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:09,930
Cooper 如果她不回來了呢
Cooper, what if she never came back for it?

2053
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:14,270
她會回來 她會的
She Will. She Will.

2054
02:31:15,480 --> 02:31:17,110
Murph 我看到他的車了
Murph, I can see his car!

2055
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:19,480
他來了 Murph
He's coming, Murph!

2056
02:31:21,320 --> 02:31:23,150
好 現在就下去
Okay. I'm coming down.

2057
02:31:24,610 --> 02:31:26,120
你怎麼知道
How do you know?

2058
02:31:29,330 --> 02:31:31,160
因為那是我給她的
Because I gave it to her.

2059
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:39,040
好的 摩爾斯電碼是點 點 橫 點
Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.

2060
02:31:42,550 --> 02:31:43,670
點 點
Dot-dot...

2061
02:31:45,010 --> 02:31:46,680
橫 點
...dash-dot.

2062
02:31:47,140 --> 02:31:48,800
點 橫 點 點
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

2063
02:31:49,180 --> 02:31:51,850
點 橫 點 點
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

2064
02:31:52,350 --> 02:31:53,680
橫 橫 橫
Dash-dash-dash.

2065
02:31:54,020 --> 02:31:56,270
橫 橫 橫
Dash, dash, dash.

2066
02:32:14,540 --> 02:32:15,870
他回來了
He came back!

2067
02:32:16,790 --> 02:32:20,960
那就是他 我知道 那就是他
It was him all the time! I knew it!!! It was him!

2068
02:32:22,050 --> 02:32:24,010
爸爸回來救我們了
Dad's gonna save us.

2069
02:33:06,760 --> 02:33:08,010
我找到了
Eureka!

2070
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:13,100
這是傳統啦
It's traditional.

2071
02:33:17,690 --> 02:33:19,310
我找到了
Eureka!

2072
02:33:24,020 --> 02:33:25,530
起作用了嗎
Did it work?

2073
02:33:25,690 --> 02:33:27,530
我覺得起作用了
I think it might have.

2074
02:33:28,900 --> 02:33:30,200
你怎麼知道
How do you know?

2075
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:33,740
因為 他們正在關閉超正方體
Because the bulk beings are closing the tesseract.

2076
02:33:37,580 --> 02:33:39,580
你還不懂嗎 TARS
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

2077
02:33:40,750 --> 02:33:42,580
他們不是別人
They're not "Beings."

2078
02:33:43,250 --> 02:33:44,590
他們就是我們自己
They're us.

2079
02:33:46,630 --> 02:33:49,760
我為Murph做的這些事 他們也在為我這麼做
What I've been doing for Murph, they're doing for me.

2080
02:33:50,300 --> 02:33:51,800
為我們所有人
For all of us.

2081
02:33:51,970 --> 02:33:54,220
Cooper 人類不可能建出這個
Cooper, people couldn't build this.

2082
02:33:54,390 --> 02:33:56,770
不 不 不 暫時不能
No. No, not yet.

2083
02:33:57,140 --> 02:33:58,600
但總有一天
But one day.

2084
02:33:59,270 --> 02:34:02,480
不是你和我 而是人類
Not you and me. But people.

2085
02:34:03,150 --> 02:34:07,190
一個進化到超越已知的四維空間的文明
A civilization that's evolved past the four dimensions we know.

2086
02:34:13,780 --> 02:34:15,280
現在又怎麼了
What happens now?

2087
02:35:17,890 --> 02:35:19,350
Cooper先生
Mr. Cooper.

2088
02:35:23,560 --> 02:35:25,270
慢慢來 先生 不要著急 先生
All right. Let's take it slow, sir.

2089
02:35:25,690 --> 02:35:27,820
慢慢來 Cooper先生
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.

2090
02:35:27,980 --> 02:35:30,870
您可不再是精力充沛的小夥子了
Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.

2091
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:33,030
其實您已經124歲了
Actually, you are 124 years old.

2092
02:35:40,040 --> 02:35:41,370
慢慢來 先生
Take it slow, sir.

2093
02:35:42,290 --> 02:35:44,580
你 呃 你太幸運了
You were, uh, extremely lucky.

2094
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:45,980
漫遊號發現你時
The Rangers found you

2095
02:35:45,980 --> 02:35:48,250
你只剩下幾分鐘的氧氣供給了
with only minutes left in your oxygen supply.

2096
02:36:02,430 --> 02:36:03,770
我在哪兒
Where am I?

2097
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:06,980
Cooper空間站
Cooper Station.

2098
02:36:08,400 --> 02:36:09,940
目前正在圍繞土星運轉
Currently orbiting Saturn.

2099
02:36:11,940 --> 02:36:13,990
Cooper空間站
Cooper Station.

2100
02:36:16,450 --> 02:36:18,450
你們能以我來命名它真是太好了
Nice of you to name it after me.

2101
02:36:22,290 --> 02:36:23,370
怎麼了
What?

2102
02:36:23,540 --> 02:36:24,990
其實空間站不是以您命名的 先生
The station isn't named after you,

2103
02:36:24,990 --> 02:36:26,750
它是 呃 以您的女兒命名的
sir. It's, uh, named after your daughter.

2104
02:36:27,250 --> 02:36:30,250
不過她一直強調您是非常重要的
Although she's always maintained just how important you were.

2105
02:36:30,420 --> 02:36:32,130
她還活著嗎
Is she still alive'?

2106
02:36:34,090 --> 02:36:35,970
她幾周後就會到這裡
She'll be here in a couple weeks.

2107
02:36:37,010 --> 02:36:39,470
她年紀太大 本不應該在空間站之間奔波
She is far too old to be transferring from another station...

2108
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:42,010
但她聽說有人找到您時
...but when she heard that you'd been found...

2109
02:36:43,220 --> 02:36:45,930
您知道Murphy Cooper是多固執的人
...well, this is, uh, Murphy Cooper we're talking about.

2110
02:36:46,810 --> 02:36:48,310
那可不
Yes, it is.

2111
02:36:50,440 --> 02:36:52,940
我們過幾天會讓您出院
We'll have you checked out of here in a couple days.

2112
02:36:55,610 --> 02:36:58,110
這裡的東西一定會讓你很激動
I'm sure you'll be excited to see what's in store.

2113
02:36:59,360 --> 02:37:03,330
我其實 呃 在高中時寫過關於您的論文
I actually, uh, did a paper on you in high school.

2114
02:37:03,660 --> 02:37:06,000
我知道您在地球上的全部人生
I know all about your life back on Earth.

2115
02:37:07,660 --> 02:37:08,830
噢 是嗎 好的
Oh, yeah.

2116
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,250
好的
Right.

2117
02:37:12,670 --> 02:37:14,660
先生 請跟我來
If-- If you'll follow me,

2118
02:37:14,660 --> 02:37:18,010
我們為您準備了非常好的住處
we've got a really good situation for you.

2119
02:37:21,350 --> 02:37:25,390
當我向Cooper女士提出這個建議時
So, uh, when I made my suggestion to Miss Cooper...

2120
02:37:26,310 --> 02:37:29,100
我很高興地聽說她欣然答應了
...I was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect.

2121
02:37:26,510 --> 02:37:31,262
敬所有勇敢的男人和女人 - 拉撒路 永恆號

2122
02:37:32,480 --> 02:37:35,780
這風沙持續不斷 日復一日 塵土飛揚
It was just constant. Just that steady blow of dirt.

2123
02:37:35,940 --> 02:37:38,860
當然 我沒有當面向她提議
Of course, I didn't speak to her personally.

2124
02:37:39,030 --> 02:37:41,030
我們總是把餐具倒扣著
We always set the plate upside-down.

2125
02:37:41,200 --> 02:37:43,950
杯子什麼的 都倒著放
Glasses or cups, whatever it was, upside-down.

2126
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:49,040
我父親是個農民 那時候大家都是農民
Well, my dad was a farmer. Uh, like everybody else back then.

2127
02:37:49,210 --> 02:37:51,670
總之 那時的糧食總是不夠
There just wasn't enough food.

2128
02:37:51,830 --> 02:37:54,540
我們會用布條
We wore little things, little strips...

2129
02:37:54,710 --> 02:37:56,510
掩住口鼻
...of sheet over our nose

2130
02:37:56,510 --> 02:37:59,880
防止吸入過多塵土
and mouth so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

2131
02:38:00,050 --> 02:38:03,510
我覺得很興奮 畢竟這是個希望
Well, it was pretty exciting for me because it was hope.

2132
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:05,110
我不管誰說的
I don't care who describes it,

2133
02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:07,890
但完全沒有誇張 當時就是那麼糟糕
there is no way for it to be exaggerated. It was that bad.

2134
02:38:08,060 --> 02:38:11,730
她也證實 您的確非常喜愛種地
She did confirm just how much you loved farming.

2135
02:38:12,060 --> 02:38:13,730
- 是嗎 她這麼說的  - 沒錯
- Oh, she did, did she? - Yeah.

2136
02:38:13,900 --> 02:38:15,110
您請
Come here.

2137
02:38:15,690 --> 02:38:20,650
好了 歡迎回家 這裡的一切都保持著原來的樣子
Home sweet home. Everything replaced and put back where it...

2138
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:29,080
- 嗨 這個是不是  - 噢 對
- Hey, is this...? - Oh, yeah.

2139
02:38:29,250 --> 02:38:32,250
我們在土星周圍發現了您和它
The machine we found out near Saturn when we found you. Yes.

2140
02:38:32,420 --> 02:38:35,090
它的電源已經失效了 如果您需要 我們可以給您換一個
Its, uh, power source was shot, but we could get you another one.

2141
02:38:35,250 --> 02:38:37,420
好的 拜託了
Yes. Please.

60% 已確認
Sixty percent confirmed.

2153
02:39:12,540 --> 02:39:15,630
- 咚咚咚  - 想被降到55%嗎
- Knock-knock. - You want 55?

2154
02:39:20,510 --> 02:39:22,630
從前真是這個樣子的嗎
Is this really what it was like?

2155
02:39:24,840 --> 02:39:27,260
從沒這麼乾淨過 小子
It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.

2156
02:39:31,770 --> 02:39:32,950
我並不是很在意這樣
I don't care much for

2157
02:39:32,950 --> 02:39:35,440
假裝一切回到了當初什麼的
this pretending we're back where we started.

2158
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:39,820
我想知道我們目前的情況
I want to know where we are.

2159
02:39:41,440 --> 02:39:42,990
我們對未來的規劃
Where we're going.

2160
02:39:47,530 --> 02:39:50,620
Cooper先生 您的家人已經都到了
Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.

2161
02:39:50,790 --> 02:39:51,870
家人
Family?

2162
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:53,710
沒錯 他們都出來見她了
Yeah, they all came out to see her.

2163
02:39:53,710 --> 02:39:55,920
她已經低溫休眠將近兩年了
She's been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

2164
02:40:28,990 --> 02:40:30,870
你跟他們說我喜歡種地嗎
You told them I like farming.

2165
02:40:36,830 --> 02:40:38,500
那就是我 Murph
It was me, Murph.

2166
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:42,750
我就是你的幽靈
I was your ghost.

2167
02:40:44,050 --> 02:40:45,670
我知道
I know.

2168
02:40:47,470 --> 02:40:49,170
別人都不相信我
People didn't believe me.

2169
02:40:49,180 --> 02:40:52,180
他們都以為那是我一個人的成就
They thought that I was doing it all myself.

2170
02:40:52,350 --> 02:40:53,390
可是
But...

2171
02:40:56,270 --> 02:40:58,230
我知道那是誰
...I knew who it was.

2172
02:41:03,190 --> 02:41:05,360
沒有人相信我
Nobody believed me.

2173
02:41:05,860 --> 02:41:08,280
但我知道你會回來
But I knew you'd come back.

2174
02:41:10,870 --> 02:41:12,080
怎麼知道
How?

2175
02:41:14,080 --> 02:41:17,210
因為我爸爸答應過我了
Because my dad promised me.

2176
02:41:23,250 --> 02:41:25,260
我回來了 Murph
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

2177
02:41:26,550 --> 02:41:27,880
我回來了
I'm here.

2178
02:41:29,340 --> 02:41:30,680
不行
No.

2179
02:41:32,760 --> 02:41:36,890
父母不應該看著自己的孩子死去
No parent should have to watch their own child die.

2180
02:41:39,810 --> 02:41:42,480
我現在有自己的孩子在這裡陪著
I have my kids here for me now.

2181
02:41:45,280 --> 02:41:46,780
你走吧
You go.

2182
02:41:49,700 --> 02:41:51,200
去哪裡
Where?

2183
02:41:54,700 --> 02:41:56,290
去找Brand
Brand.

2184
02:42:06,130 --> 02:42:07,760
她還在太空中
She's out there...

2185
02:42:14,180 --> 02:42:15,930

...setting up camp.

2186

沐浴著新太陽的光芒
