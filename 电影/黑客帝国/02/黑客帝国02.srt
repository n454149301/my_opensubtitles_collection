重 装 上 阵
R E L O A D E D

5
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,220
明天见
See you tomorrow.

6
00:01:50,755 --> 00:01:51,723
哦，上帝啊！
Oh, my God!

7
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:15,560
我进来了
I'm in.

8
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:10,802
我们就快到了
We're almost there.

9
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:15,122
-长官，你有把握吗？  -我说过，不会出问题的
-Sir, are you sure about this?  -I told you, we're going to be all right.

10
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:20,405
我明白，长官  只是我观测到，那儿有大量的哨兵活动
I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping some serious sentinel activity up here.

11
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:01,187
-林克  -长官？
-Link.  -Yes, sir?

12
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:04,398
考虑到你的情况，我还是不能明白……
Given your situation, I can't say I fully understand your reasons...

13
00:05:04,423 --> 00:05:07,130
你为什么要志愿到我的舰上工作
...for volunteering to operate onboard my ship.

14
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:11,525
不过，如果你想继续干下去，我有件事需要你去做
However, if you wish to continue to do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

15
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,262
什么事，长官？
What's that, sir?

16
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:15,389
要信任我
To trust me.

17
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:17,712
是，长官  我会的
Yes, sir.  I will, sir.

18
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:22,749
-我是说，我一定做到  -但愿如此
-I mean, I do, sir.  -I hope so.

19
00:05:23,086 --> 00:05:26,395
现在将主电源重新接到硬盘驱动器上，准备广播信号吧
Now repatch the main AC to the hard drives and stand by to broadcast.

20
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,433
是，长官
Yes, sir.

21
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,110
还是睡不着吗？
Still can't sleep?

22
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,870
想谈谈吗？
You wanna talk?

23
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:46,363
只是做了个噩梦
They're just dreams.

24
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:51,365
如果你是在担心什么……
If you're afraid of something....

25
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,245
我只是希望……
I just wish....

26
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:56,362
希望知道自己该去做哪些事
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

27
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:58,183
仅此而已
That's all.

28
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:00,816
我真希望能知道
I just wish I knew.

29
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,365
她会和你联系的  别再担心了
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

30
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,355
找到你们了
Here you are.

31
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,256
-我们该出发了吗？  -已经要迟到了
-Are we ready to go?  -We're already late.

32
00:06:10,593 --> 00:06:14,412
这些地热成像图证实了冥王号发回的最后一条讯息
These geotherms confirm the last transmission of the Osiris.

33
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,299
机器正在钻洞
The machines are digging.

34
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,476
它们要从地表一直挖到锡安
They're boring from the surface down to Zion.

35
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,401
-妈的   -它们想避开我们的整个外围防御
-Mother   -They'll avoid the entire perimeter defense.

36
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,785
它们移动的速度有多快？
How fast are they moving?

37
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,420
-控制中心估计速度是100米/每小时  -该死
-Control estimates their descent at 100 meters an hour.  -Shit.

38
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:32,054
-现在挖了多深？  -大约2000米
-How deep are they?  -Almost 2000 meters.

39
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,371
-冥王号的观测结果如何？  -他们不可能是准的
-What about the scans from the Osiris?  -They can't be accurate.

40
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,932
-但也可能是对的  -这不可能
-They may be.  -It's not possible.

41
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:40,198
这就意味着有25万乌贼哨兵
That'd mean there are a quartermillion sentinels out there.

42
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:42,035
-没错  -那不可能
-That's right.  -That can't be.

43
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,620
为什么不可能？
Why not?

44
00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:47,886
一只乌贼对付一个人类，锡安的男女老幼都算进去
A sentinel for every man, woman and child in Zion.

45
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,715
对我来说，那完全符合机器的思维逻辑
That sounds exactly like the thinking of a machine to me.

46
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,900
墨菲斯，你能来真是太好了
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

47
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:56,617
奈奥比
Niobe.

48
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:00,411
抱歉我来迟了
My apologies to all.

49
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:05,314
你们无疑也明白，要找到安全的广播位置越来越困难了
But as you are undoubtedly aware it's become increasingly difficult to locate a secure broadcast position.

50
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,992
-最好的位置都被乌贼占了  -它们把主管道都给挤满了
-Squiddies got our best spots.   -Main lines are crawling with them.

51
00:07:08,017 --> 00:07:12,325
如果奈奥比是对的，72小时内它们的数量会超过25万
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours there's gonna be a quartermillion more.

52
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,560
我们应该如何应对呢？
What are we gonna do about it?

53
00:07:13,585 --> 00:07:16,105
我们按照洛克指挥官的命令去做……
We're gonna do what Commander Lock ordered us to do.

54
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,817
撤出广播信号的深度，返回锡安
We'll evacuate broadcast level and return to Zion.

55
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:23,960
指挥官有没有什么对策来抵御二十五万哨兵呢？
And does the commander have a plan for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

56
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,987
战略仍在制定中
A strategy is still being formulated.

57
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:28,939
相信如此
I'm sure it is.

58
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,700
（史密斯的车牌号是IS5416，对应圣经《以塞亚书》第54章16节 <i>Isaiah 54:16</i>：
"Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals, and produces a weapon for its purpose. I have also created the ravager to destroy;"
“看啊，是我造了扇旺炭火、
铸造合用兵器的铁匠(Smith)，
是我造了毁灭者”）

59
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:46,273
那你认为我们应该做什么，墨菲斯？
What do you think we should do,  Morpheus?

60
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:48,475
-我们本该听命行事……  -怎么了？
-We should proceed as ordered...  -What is it?

61
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,254
-不知道  -但是，我必须向你们中的一个请求帮助……
I don't know. ...however, I must ask one of you for help.

62
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:58,054
你们中有些人信我所信，有些人不信
Some of you believe as I believe, some of you do not.  But those of you that do...

63
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,844
但那些即使不信的人也得承认：我们已经到了抗争的最后关头
...know we are nearing the end of our struggle.

64
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:05,260
救世主预言很快就会应验  但在那之前……
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon. But before it can be...

65
00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:07,996
必须求教先知
...the Oracle must be consulted.

66
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:16,301
（注意墙上的涂鸦
最简单的解读方式是，意指 圣经 旧约 诗篇 25:19：
“看啊，我的仇敌众多，他们都痛恨我”）

67
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:19,061
如果我们现在回去充电的话...
If we return and recharge now...

68
00:08:19,086 --> 00:08:23,364
36小时内即可返回，远早于机器挖到这个深度
...we can be back in 36 hours, well before the machines reach this depth.

69
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:25,142
你知道自己是要求什么吗？
Do you understand what you're asking?

70
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:28,445
我是要求有一艘战舰留在这里
I am asking that one ship remain here in our place...

71
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,125
以备先知与我们取得联系
...just in case the Oracle should attempt to contact us.

72
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,452
放屁  你这是要我们当中的一艘船去抗命
Bullshit.  You're asking one of us to disobey a direct order.

73
00:08:34,477 --> 00:08:39,066
没错，我是   不过大家都很清楚，我们中的大部分之所以来到这里……
That's right, I am.  But we well know that the reason most of us are here...

74
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,588
就是因为有叛逆倾向
...is because of our affinity for disobedience.

75
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:46,124
如果你回锡安后，指挥官把你投入监狱怎么办？
And what happens when you get to Zion and the commander throws you in the stockade?

76
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:47,679
他不会
He won't.

77
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:51,868
见鬼， 墨菲斯，你真是顽固不化
Goddamn it, Morpheus, you ain't never gonna change.

78
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:55,613
那好吧，我可以留下  我倒要看看你要怎么打破僵局
Shit, I'll do it just to see what Deadbolt does to you.

79
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:57,133
给你36个小时
You got 36 hours.

80
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:02,205
我找尼奥
I'm looking for Neo.

81
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:05,578
-没说听过这个人  -我有东西给他
Never heard of him. I have something for him.

82
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:08,522
一件礼物
A gift.

83
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:11,453
知道吗，是他让我自由了
You see, he set me free.

84
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,669
好吧，随你怎么说  现在滚吧
Fine, whatever.  Now piss off.

85
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:20,226
-什么人？  -你怎么知道有人找你的？
-Who was that?   -How did you know someone was here?

86
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:21,809
他要给你这个
He gave you this.

87
00:09:27,747 --> 00:09:29,177
他说是你让他自由了
He said you set him free.

88
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:32,995
一切都还好吧，长官？
Is everything all right, sir?

89
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:36,528
会议结束了，回你们的船上去吧
The meeting is over.  Retreat to your exits.

90
00:09:36,553 --> 00:09:38,286
-特工就要来了  -特工？
-Agents are coming.   -Agents?

91
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:40,426
快走
Go.

92
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,506
嗨，伙计们
Hiya, fellas.

93
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:52,745
就是他  那个变异
It's him.  The anomaly.

94
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,265
-还要继续吗？ -是的
-Do we proceed?  -Yes.

95
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,823
-他依然...  -只是人类
-He is still...  -Only human.

96
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:04,913
升级了
Upgrades.

97
00:11:00,346 --> 00:11:02,713
-一切都按预期进行  -是的
-That went as expected.  -Yes.

98
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,660
跟以前发生的一模一样
It's happening exactly as before.

99
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,085
好吧，也不尽然
Well, not exactly.

100
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:14,323
-那儿发生了什么，林克？  -我搞不明白
-What happened at that, Link?   -I can't figure it out,sir.

101
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:16,225
突然凭空出现了特工
Agents just came out of nowhere.

102
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,205
接着代码全都变得怪异了  加密模式是我从没见过的
Then the code got all weird.  Encryption I've never seen.

103
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,415
-尼奥没事吧？  -没事 见鬼，你真该亲眼看看的
-Is Neo okay?   -Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.

104
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,880
他现在在哪儿？
Where is he now?

105
00:11:25,415 --> 00:11:27,146
正在扮演超人呢
He's doing his Superman thing.

106
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,476
你去哪儿了？
Where are you?

107
00:12:23,196 --> 00:12:26,796
尼布加尼撒号即将进站，请求使用通过三号入口
This is the Nebuchadnezzar on approach, requesting access through Gate Three.

108
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:35,236
尼布加尼撒号，这里是锡安控制台  保持当前航速，等候指令
Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.  Maintain present velocity and stand by.

109
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:37,042
收到
Roger that, Control.

110
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,648
这里是锡安基地控制台，请求立即解除三号入口的封锁
This is Control requesting immediate standdown of arms at Gate Three.

111
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:44,666
尼布加尼撒号准备进站  三号入口即将打开
We have the Nebuchadnezzar on approach.  Let's open her up.

112
00:12:50,393 --> 00:12:53,275
尼布加尼撒号，准许你们由三号入口进入第七停机坪
Nebuchadnezzar, You are cleared through Gate Three to Bay Seven.

113
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,900
收到
Roger that, Control.

114
00:13:02,423 --> 00:13:05,410
门已打开，床已铺好  欢迎回家
Door's open, bed's made. Welcome home.

115
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,848
回家真好
No place like it.

116
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:26,073
收到了  锡安控制台，准备关闭三号入口
Roger that, Control. Zion Control, stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

117
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:18,066
尼布加尼撒号已经降落  七号停机坪
The Nebuchadnezzar is down. Bay Seven.

118
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,289
明白
Understood.

119
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:30,839
米孚安舰长
Captain Mifune.

120
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:33,021
墨菲斯舰长
Captain Morpheus.

121
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:35,793
你是来押我去监狱的吗，舰长？
Are you here to escort me to the stockade, captain?

122
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:39,341
-我无意挑起争端  -洛克指挥官命令你……
-I'm just here to keep the peace.   -Commander Lock demands

123
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:43,872
要求你立刻去见他，长官！
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

124
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,563
-林克  -长官？
-Link.  -Sir?

125
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,396
我要让战舰尽快做好启程准备
I want the ship ready to go as soon as possible.

126
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,956
明白，长官
Understood, sir.

127
00:14:58,376 --> 00:15:00,696
他俩之间发生过什么吗？  墨菲斯和洛克？
What is it between them?  Morpheus and Lock?

128
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:04,066
-因为奈奥比  -奈奥比舰长？
-Niobe.  -Captain Niobe?

129
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:07,464
她过去和墨菲斯在一起，现在却和洛克好上了
She used to be with Morpheus.  Now she's with Lock.

130
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,315
出了什么事？
What happened?

131
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,760
墨菲斯见过先知后，一切都变了
Morpheus went to the Oracle. After that, everything changed.

132
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:16,549
好吧，她是做得到
Yeah, she can do that.

133
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:17,987
尼奥
Neo!

134
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:21,931
-哦，不是吧   -他怎么每次都知道？
-Oh, no.   -How does he always know?

135
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,053
他就没别的事情可做吗？
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

136
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:26,845
谁叫你救了他一命呢
You know what they say about the life you save.

137
00:15:27,314 --> 00:15:28,617
不是我救了他
I didn't save his life.

138
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,094
（the Kid 是《黑客帝国动画版》<i>The Animatrix</i> 中,《少年故事》主角
他跟尼奥联系后被特工追捕，走投无路之下选择跳楼自杀，结果竟然在真实世界里醒来
所以算是自己救了自己）

139
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:32,320
你好，尼奥
Hiya, Neo.

140
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:35,785
崔妮蒂  林克
Trinity, Link.  Hey.

141
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:40,106
-你能回来真是太好了  -谢谢  回来真好
-It's great to have you back.  -Thanks.  It's good to be back.

142
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:42,781
-我来帮你拿好吗？  -不，我自己背得动
-Can I carry that for you?  -No, I can carry my own bag.

143
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:44,775
-崔妮蒂？  -我能行
-Trinity?   -I'm fine.

144
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:48,696
-那你帮忙拿这些吧   -好的，当然可以，林克
-You can carry these.   -Yeah, sure, Link.

145
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,300
你知道的，明年我就够年龄成为舰员了，对吧？
Hey, you know, next year I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

146
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:01,188
对此我已经想了很久，我已经决定……
I've been thinking about it, and I've made my decision.

147
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:02,541
我猜……
Let me guess.

148
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:05,239
我要加入尼布加尼撒号
I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.

149
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,660
我知道墨菲斯还没找到舰员来填补其他岗位   除了你那个，林克
I know Morpheus hasn't filled the other crew position, except for you, Link.

150
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,189
当然，他有自己的考量……
I'm sure he has reasons...

151
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:14,361
不过我越想就越觉得，这应该就是天意
...but the more I think about it, the more I think it's meant to be.

152
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:16,675
你知道的，命中注定
You know, it's fate.

153
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:20,792
-我能来这儿全是因为你，尼奥  -我告诉过你，孩子，是你主动找到了我，不是我去找你
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.   -I told you, kid, you found me.  I didn't find you.

154
00:16:20,903 --> 00:16:23,516
但毕竟是你把我解救出来的   你救了我
I know, but you got me out.  You saved me.

155
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,183
是你自己救了自己
You saved yourself.

156
00:16:42,675 --> 00:16:45,421
-墨菲斯  -洛克指挥官
-Morpheus.  -Commander Lock.

157
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:50,696
我其他舰长谈过了  我想给你个机会好好解释解
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to offer you a chance to explain your actions.

158
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:53,763
我不认为我的所作所为需要任何解释
I wasn't aware that my actions required any explanation.

159
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:56,281
我下达了直接命令让你们返回锡安
You were given a direct order to return to Zion.

160
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,155
-我返回了  -可你让一艘战舰留在原地
-I did.  -But you asked for one ship to remain behind.

161
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,817
本该是我留下，但是我的战舰需要充电
I would have stayed, but I needed to recharge my ship.

162
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:05,092
所以你是承认自己公然违抗命令
So you admit to a direct contravention of your duty.

163
00:17:05,117 --> 00:17:08,439
可是指挥官，我们需要有人留在矩阵里以备先知的联络
Commander, we need a presence inside the Matrix to await contact from the Oracle.

164
00:17:08,464 --> 00:17:10,595
我不想听那些鬼话！
I don't want to hear that shit!

165
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:13,290
我才不在乎什么先知、预言或是救世主！
I don't care about oracles or prophecies or messiahs!

166
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:16,880
我只关心一事，那就是要阻止敌人毁灭这座城
I care about one thing: Stopping that army from destroying this city.

167
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:19,860
要做到这一点，所有士兵都必须服从我的命令
To do that I need soldiers to obey my orders.

168
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:24,630
无意冒犯，指挥官，只有一种办法可以拯救我们的城市
With all due respect, commander, there is only one way to save our city.

169
00:17:24,883 --> 00:17:25,977
是什么？
How?

170
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:29,398
-尼奥  -见鬼去吧，墨菲斯！
-Neo.  -Goddamn it, Morpheus！

171
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,970
不是人人都信你所信
Not everyone believes what you believe.

172
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,210
我所相信的，无需他人同信
My beliefs do not require them to.

173
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:46,465
今晚有个集会  大家可以畅所欲言，很多人吓坏了
There's a gathering tonight.  Everyone's talking.  A lot of people are scared.

174
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,339
这么多战舰集结的情形已经多年未见了
No one remembers the last time so many ships were docked.

175
00:17:49,364 --> 00:17:52,464
-一定有什么事情要发生，对吗？一件大事  -嘿
-Something is happening, isn't it, Something big?   -Hey.

176
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,346
不是什么事都可以告诉你，所以别再问了
We're not allowed to say anything, so stop asking.

177
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:03,516
老天呐，回家的感觉真好
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

178
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,301
我将向议会提议解除你的职务
I'm recommending the council that you be removed from duty.

179
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:22,630
那当然是你的特权，指挥官
That is, of course, your prerogative, commander.

180
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,669
如果有权决定的是我，舰长，你今后再也别想踏上战舰一步！
If it were up to me, captain, you wouldn't set foot on a ship for the rest of your life.

181
00:18:26,694 --> 00:18:30,130
那我得庆幸：你并没有决定权
Then I am grateful that it is not up to you.

182
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:38,466
-哈曼议员  -指挥官
-Councillor Hamann.  -Commander.

183
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:41,555
-舰长  -议员
-Captain.  -Councillor.

184
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:45,544
议会要求我，在今晚的神庙集会上演讲
Council's asked me to speak tonight at the temple gathering.

185
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,610
舰队的集结和持续的流言必须予以解释
The presence of the fleet and the persistence of rumors must be addressed.

186
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,320
人民必须被告知发生了什么
The people must be told what is happening.

187
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:54,052
当然要解释的，议员
Of course, councillor.

188
00:18:55,129 --> 00:19:00,305
不过请允许我提议，对某些具体细节作斟酌处理
But might I advise a level of discretion concerning specific details.

189
00:19:00,528 --> 00:19:03,356
-我们不希望引起过度恐慌   -说的很对
-We do not wish to start a panic.  -Quite right.

190
00:19:03,662 --> 00:19:06,446
恐慌不是人人都想要的
A panic is not what anyone wants.

191
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:10,577
你呢，舰长？ 有什么建议吗？
What about you, captain?  What would you advise?

192
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:17,273
必须告知真相  没人会对真相恐慌，因为我们没有什么好怕的
The truth.  No one will panic, because there is nothing to fear.

193
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:19,751
敌人将永远无法踏进锡安的大门
That army will never reach the gates of Zion.

194
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:24,065
-你何以如此确定呢？  -就以我们的亲眼所见，议员
What makes you so sure? Consider what we have seen, councillor.

195
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:28,481
就凭过去六个月，我们解放了比过去六年还多的意识
Consider that in the past six months, we have freed more minds than in six years.

196
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:31,380
这次进攻是孤注一掷之举
This attack is an act of desperation.

197
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,303
我相信，预言不久就会应验，战争很快就将结束
I believe very soon the prophecy will be fulfilled and this war will end.

198
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,400
希望你是对的，舰长
I hope you're right, captain.

199
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:42,293
我相信它并非某种“愿景”，议员
I do not believe it to be a matter of hope, councillor.

200
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:45,018
它只是，尚未发生的事实
It is simply a matter of time.

201
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:48,755
我到了
My stop.

202
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:50,355
回头见
See you soon.

203
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:51,945
希望不要太快
Hopefully not too soon.

204
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:54,925
走吧，孩子，他们俩还有事情要做
Let's go, kid. These two got things to do.

205
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:06,348
你跟我想的一样吗？
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

206
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,920
如果你也觉得刚才太他妈漫长，那我们想的一样
I am if you're thinking this elevator is too damns long.

207
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:12,231
-战舰需要充多久的电？ -24到30个小时
-How long do we charge the Neb? -Twentyfour, maybe 30 hours.

208
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:16,800
真是我这辈子听过的最好的消息
Some people go their entire lives without hearing news that good.

209
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:45,858
尼奥，求你了  我儿子雅各在gnosis号上
（希腊语 gnosis 意为 knowledge）
Neo, please, I have a son, Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.

210
00:20:45,883 --> 00:20:49,131
-求你多多关照他  -我会尽力的
-Please, watch over him.  -I'll try.

211
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:52,394
我女儿在lcarus号上
（lcarus 即伊卡洛斯，希腊神话中的悲剧人物
代达罗斯与伊卡洛斯父子使用蜡质羽翼逃离克里特岛时，伊卡洛斯飞的太靠近太阳，最终落水而亡
悲伤的代达罗斯飞回家乡后，将自己那对蜡翼悬挂在阿波罗神殿里，从此不再飞翔）
I have a daughter on the lcarus.

212
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,570
不，别走
No, wait.

213
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:56,434
没关系，他们需要你
It's all right. They need you.

214
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:58,683
-可我需要你  -我知道
-I need you.  -I know.

215
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:01,015
我们还有时间
There's time.

216
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,623
我的小猫咪在哪里？
Where's my puss?

217
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,311
林克叔叔
Hey!  Uncle Link!

218
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:12,897
天呐
God!

219
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:14,871
林克叔叔
Uncle Link!

220
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:19,079
我的老天，都长这么大了
Oh, my God!  You're so huge!

221
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:21,341
-应该是你们来抱我的！  -不要！
-You should be picking me up!   -No!

222
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:22,985
-好不好？ -好吧
-Yeah!  -Okay!

223
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,700
好了吗？ 那行啊
Okay?  All right.

224
00:21:24,947 --> 00:21:28,033
让我们一起使劲，好不好？
Now, we're gonna have to work together here, okay?

225
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,425
一、二、三，起！
One, two, three, lift!

226
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,734
老天，你给他们吃什么了？
Oh, my God!  What are you feeding these two?

227
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:36,560
好了，孩子们，该睡觉了
Come on, kids.  It's time to go.

228
00:21:38,342 --> 00:21:39,712
-嗨，凯丝  -嗨
-Hey, Cas.  -Hey.

229
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,720
-真高兴你回家，林克  -回家真好
-Good to have you home, Link.   -Good to be home.

230
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,467
你对她可要小心点儿
You be careful with her.

231
00:21:44,492 --> 00:21:47,351
别担心我了，该担心的是他
Don't worry about me.  He's the one that's gonna get it.

232
00:21:49,593 --> 00:21:51,972
该出门了，你们两个，咱们走吧
Out the door!  Both of you, march!

233
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:53,769
拜拜
Bye! Bye!

234
00:22:00,623 --> 00:22:02,153
我该怎么着？
I'm gonna get what?

235
00:22:03,543 --> 00:22:07,647
其他战舰回家的次数是尼布加尼撒号的两到三倍
Every ship up there's been home two, even three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.

236
00:22:07,672 --> 00:22:11,693
好啦，姬伊  我们不是不谈这个了吗
Come on, Zee.  I thought we were past this.

237
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:15,204
-只有等你换了战舰，我们才能不谈这个  -我不能这么做
-We will get pass this when you start operating another ship.
-I can't do that.

238
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:16,805
-为什么？  -你是知道的
-Why?   -You know why.

239
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,180
要是多泽知道我的感受，当初就不会让你这么做了
If Dozer knew how I felt, he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

240
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,096
可能吧，不过太迟了
Maybe. But it's too late now.

241
00:22:23,473 --> 00:22:26,215
我做过承诺，有些承诺是不可以违背的
I made a promise, and some promises can't be unmade.

242
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,889
-这不公平  -没人说过这世上很公平
-It's not fair.  -Nobody said it was gonna be.

243
00:22:29,296 --> 00:22:32,449
你觉得我回来了可多泽走了，对凯丝来说公平吗？
You think Cas thinks it's fair that I'm here and Dozer's not?

244
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:41,020
我在那艘船上失去了两个兄弟，林克
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

245
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:44,566
我好害怕
I'm afraid of it.

246
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:48,289
害怕你也被它害死
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

247
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:51,375
不会的
It won't.

248
00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:53,420
你怎么敢说不会？
How can you say that to me?

249
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:54,965
是因为墨菲斯
Because of Morpheus.

250
00:22:55,946 --> 00:23:00,427
他对我说过，这就是最后一战，而且很快就会结束
Because of what he's told me.  He said that this is it, that it will be over soon.

251
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:04,107
-林克，墨菲斯就是疯了  -一点不假
-Link, Morpheus is crazy.   -No doubt.

252
00:23:05,155 --> 00:23:07,960
可是坦克和多泽都相信他  我来告诉你为什么……
But Tank and Dozer believed him.  And I'll tell you what...

253
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:13,591
我上了那条战舰以后，看到了尼奥的所作所为
...after being on that ship and seeing Neo do the things he can do, I gotta say...

254
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,065
我得说：我也开始相信他了
...I'm starting to believe him too.

255
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:23,340
注意安全，林克
Be careful, Link.

256
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:30,919
你一定得注意安全
Please be careful.

257
00:23:40,424 --> 00:23:43,758
-已经开始了吗？  -哈曼议员才刚开始祷告呢
-They started yet?  -Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.

258
00:23:43,783 --> 00:23:47,167
今晚，让荣光归于所有男人和女人
Tonight, let us honor these men and women.

259
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,867
士兵和勇士
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

260
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,128
丈夫和妻子，兄弟和姐妹
These are our husbands and wives, our brothers and sisters...

261
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:56,048
以及我们的孩子们
...our children.

262
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:59,650
让我们永远铭记那些牺牲者
Let us remember those that have been lost...

263
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,397
也感谢那些觉醒者
...and let us give thanks for those that have been found...

264
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:06,456
那些和我们站在了一起的人们
...and who stand here beside us.

265
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:10,369
下面，我想有请另一个人替我完成这次祷告
Now I would like someone else to close this prayer...

266
00:24:10,801 --> 00:24:13,923
他已经很久没有在这里发言了……
...someone who hasn't spoken here in a long time...

267
00:24:14,056 --> 00:24:19,203
但我相信，他所要讲的将是值得一听的
...but who I believe has something to say that we all need to hear.

268
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,091
下面欢迎墨菲斯
I give you Morpheus.

269
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:45,663
锡安的子民们！ 听我说！
Zion!  Hear me!

270
00:24:46,763 --> 00:24:50,003
你们中的很多人听说的正是事实
It is true what many of you have heard.

271
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:54,095
机器的军队已经集结，就在我说话的时候……
The machines have gathered an army, and as I speak...

272
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,857
那支大军还在向我们的家园掘进
...that army is drawing nearer to our home.

273
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:04,545
相信我，我们将面临一段艰难时期
Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us.

274
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:11,230
但是，如果我们要为此做好准备，首先要做的必须是放下恐惧！
But if we are to be prepared for it, we must first shed our fear of it.

275
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:16,490
我现在站在你们面前，没有丝毫的恐惧
I stand here before you now truthfully unafraid.

276
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,647
为什么？
Why?

277
00:25:19,276 --> 00:25:22,076
是因为我相信某些你们不信的事吗？
Because I believe something you do not?

278
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:23,747
不！
No!

279
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,327
我毫无恐惧地站在这里是因为我记得
I stand here without fear because I remember.

280
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:33,505
我记得，我还能站在这里不是因为未来的事物……
I remember that I am here not because of the path that lies before me...

281
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,693
而是因为过去的历史！
...but because of the path that lies behind me.

282
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:41,715
我记得，一百年多年来，我们一直在和机器战斗
I remember that for 100 years we have fought these machines.

283
00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:47,193
我记得，一百多年来，它们不断地派兵毁灭我们
I remember that for 100 years they have sent their armies to destroy us.

284
00:25:47,218 --> 00:25:53,297
经过一个世纪的战争，我记得，最重要是的：
And after a century of war, I remember that which matters most:

285
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,667
我们仍然在此挺立！
We are still here!

286
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,556
今晚……
Tonight...

287
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:09,120
让我们把这样一条讯息告诉我们的敌人
...Let us send a message to that army.

288
00:26:09,312 --> 00:26:12,203
今晚，我们要让这个洞窟倾覆
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

289
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:19,926
今晚，我们要让世间万物颤抖
Tonight, let us tremble these halls of earth, steel and stone.

290
00:26:19,951 --> 00:26:25,165
让我们的声音响彻全球
Let us be heard from red core to black sky.

291
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:29,810
今晚，我们要让敌人明白：
Tonight, let us make them remember:

292
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:34,810
这里是锡安！我们无所畏惧！
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

293
00:26:58,346 --> 00:27:00,166
我记得一些事
I remember.

294
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,373
我记得你过去经常跳舞
I remember you used to dance.

295
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,245
我记得你跳得，非常好
I remember you were, pretty good.

296
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:12,840
在这个世上有一些事情，奈奥比舰长……
There are some things in this world, Captain Niobe...

297
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,060
永远不会改变
...that will never change.

298
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,970
奈奥比！
Niobe!

299
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,900
还有一些确实会变
Some things do change.

300
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:46,710
失陪了
Excuse me.

301
00:27:58,841 --> 00:28:01,756
-我想你  -我知道
-I missed you.  -I can tell.

302
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,460
我在想，这里人太多了
I was thinking, everyone is here.

303
00:28:07,176 --> 00:28:08,666
跟我来吧
Follow me.

304
00:31:30,213 --> 00:31:33,586
尼奥，怎么了？
Neo, what is it?

305
00:31:34,216 --> 00:31:36,388
有什么不对吗？
What's wrong?

306
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:40,121
没关系的，请告诉我
It's okay, you can tell me.

307
00:31:40,743 --> 00:31:43,102
崔妮蒂……
Trinity....

308
00:31:43,406 --> 00:31:46,010
不要害怕
Don't be afraid.

309
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,490
我不能失去你
I can't lose you.

310
00:31:48,893 --> 00:31:50,709
你不会失去我的
You're not gonna lose me.

311
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:57,378
你感觉到了吗？
You feel this?

312
00:31:58,011 --> 00:31:59,610
我永远不会放手的
I'm never letting go.

313
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:39,406
晚安，锡安
Good night, Zion.

314
00:32:39,703 --> 00:32:42,363
做个好梦
Sweet dreams.

315
00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:54,131
-你还好吧？  -我没事的
-You all right?   -I'll make it.

316
00:32:54,156 --> 00:32:56,956
看到那特工了吗？ 我从没见过那种样子
Did you see that agent?  I've never seen anything like that.

317
00:32:56,981 --> 00:32:59,326
别管他了  重要的是这个
It doesn't matter.  All that matters is this.

318
00:32:59,351 --> 00:33:00,521
你先来
You first.

319
00:33:12,697 --> 00:33:15,490
-哦，上帝  -叫“史密斯”就好
-Oh, God.  -"Smith" will suffice.

320
00:33:27,523 --> 00:33:30,303
-谢谢  -不必客气
-Thank you.  -My pleasure.

321
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:23,833
-不介意有人陪你吧？ -哈曼议员
-Care for some company?   -Councillor Hamann.

322
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:27,780
如果你想一个人呆着，我不勉强
I don't want to intrude if you'd prefer to be alone.

323
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:31,576
不会的，我大概正需要有人陪着   -那就好
-No, I could probably use some company.   -Good.

324
00:34:32,132 --> 00:34:33,475
我也是
So could l.

325
00:34:37,736 --> 00:34:40,106
今晚夜色真美
It's nice tonight.

326
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:42,653
非常平静
Very calm.

327
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:45,891
似乎所有人都已经安然入睡了
It feels like everyone is sleeping very peacefully.

328
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:48,665
并非所有人
Not everyone.

329
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:53,811
我讨厌睡觉，我每天只睡几个小时
I hate sleeping.  I never sleep more than a few hours.

330
00:34:54,076 --> 00:34:58,036
我想是因为，我这辈子的前11年里都在沉睡，现在要用醒着作为补偿
I figure I slept the first 11 years of my life, now I'm making up for it.

331
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:03,506
-你呢？  -我从来就睡不好
-What about you?   -I just haven't been able to sleep much.

332
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:07,945
-这是个好迹象  -说明什么？
-It's a good sign.   -Of what?

333
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:11,217
表明你实际上，仍属于人类
That you are in fact, still human.

334
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:18,592
你去过下面的基础设施层吗？
Have you ever been to the engineering level?

335
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,773
我喜欢晚上到那儿去  真是令人震撼
I love to walk there at night.  It's quite amazing.

336
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:24,499
-想去看看吗？  -当然
-Would you like to see it?   -Sure.

337
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:39,583
平时几乎没人来这儿  当然，除非是出了问题
Almost no one comes down here.  Unless, of course, there's a problem.

338
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:44,848
人们就是如此  只要它能正常运转，没人会关心它到底是如何运作的
That's how it is with people. Nobody cares how it works as long as it works.

339
00:35:45,275 --> 00:35:47,077
我喜欢这下面的一切
I like it down here.

340
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:52,904
我总喜欢提醒自己，正是这些机器让这个城市得以维系
I like to be reminded this city survives because of these machines.

341
00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:58,450
这些机器保障了我们的生存，然而另外一些却要毁灭我们
These machines are keeping us alive while other machines are coming to kill us.

342
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,901
很有意思，不是吗？ 给养生命的能力……
Interesting, isn't it?  The power to give life...

343
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:07,245
-也可以毁灭生命   -我们也有同样的能力
-...and the power to end it.   -We have the same power.

344
00:36:07,572 --> 00:36:09,972
是啊，我们是有这个能力，不过……
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

345
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:14,062
在这下面，有时候，我会想到那些仍然被插头接在矩阵里人们……
...down here sometimes I think about those people still plugged into the Matrix.

346
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:16,960
然后当我看到这些机器……
And when I look at these machines...

347
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:22,668
不禁想到，从某种意义上，我们也被接在了上面，完全要依赖它们维生
...I can't help thinking that, in a way, we are plugged into them.

348
00:36:22,693 --> 00:36:25,553
但是，是我们在控制这些机器，而不是它们去控制我们
But we control these machines, they don't control us.

349
00:36:26,012 --> 00:36:28,866
当然不是了，它们怎么会呢？
Of course not.   How could they?

350
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:31,599
这完全没道理  但是……
The idea is pure nonsense. But...

351
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:35,295
但是它确实会引人深思...
...but it does make one wonder just...

352
00:36:35,392 --> 00:36:37,006
到底什么是控制？
...what is control?

353
00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:40,025
只要我们想要，就可以把这些机器关掉
If we wanted, we could shut these machines down.

354
00:36:40,723 --> 00:36:45,420
呵呵  当然  你说到点子上了  这就是你认为的“控制”，对吧？
Of course.  That's it.  You hit it.  That's control, isn't it?

355
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,179
只要我们乐意，就尽可以把它们捣成碎片……
If we wanted, we could smash them to bits.

356
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:53,583
只是这么做了之后，我们就不得不面临停电……
Although if we did, we'd have to consider what would happen to our lights...

357
00:36:53,676 --> 00:36:56,631
没有暖气，没法呼吸
...our heat, our air.

358
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,449
所以我们和机器是相互依存的关系  这就是你的论点吗，议员？
So we need machines and they need us.  Is that your point, councillor?

359
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,049
不！称不上论点
No.  No point.

360
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,316
像我这样的老古董，哪里会费心提出什么论点  这谈不上论点
Old men like me don't bother with making points.  There's no point.

361
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:13,185
这就是议会里没有年轻人的原因吗？
Is that why there are no young men on the Council?

362
00:37:13,913 --> 00:37:15,547
是个好观点
Good point.

363
00:37:16,262 --> 00:37:18,756
你为何不直接把心里话告诉我呢，议员
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind, councillor.

364
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:23,095
这世上有太多……
There is so much in this world...

365
00:37:23,923 --> 00:37:26,725
我还未能理解的事物
...that I do not understand.

366
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:33,430
看到那边的机器了吗？ 它是用作供水循环的
See that machine?  It has something to do with recycling our water supply.

367
00:37:33,455 --> 00:37:36,547
我全然不能理解它的工作原理
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

368
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:40,295
但我能理解要让它工作的原因
But I do understand the reason for it to work.

369
00:37:42,462 --> 00:37:46,690
我也全然不清楚你是怎么办到那些事情的
I have absolutely no idea how you are able to do some of the things you do.

370
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:51,206
但我同样相信，其中自有原因
But I believe there's a reason for that as well.

371
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:57,172
我只希望我们能找到原因，在一切都为时已晚之前
I only hope we understand that reason before it's too late.

372
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,390
-巴勒德   -尼奥在吗？
-Ballard.   -ls he here?

373
00:38:07,896 --> 00:38:10,456
尼奥，这是先知给的
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

374
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:14,987
该动身了
It's time to go.

375
00:38:16,058 --> 00:38:18,548
墨菲斯说这是注定会发生的
Morpheus said this was how it was gonna happen.

376
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:23,373
我不知道  预言也许是真的，也许不是
I don't know.  Maybe the prophecy's true, maybe it's not.

377
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:27,126
我只知道，那艘战舰需要接线员
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.

378
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,147
而现在，我就是那个接线员
Right now, that operator's me.

379
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:32,274
我知道
I know.

380
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:39,655
-姬伊……  -我要你戴上这个
-Zee....   -I want you to wear it.

381
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,790
-你知道我是不信这个的   -但是我信
-You know I don't believe in this stuff.   -But I do.

382
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:45,460
它总能给我带来好运
It's always brought me luck.

383
00:38:46,395 --> 00:38:50,214
-也许也能带给你   -我会平安回来的
-Maybe it'll bring me you.   -I'm coming back.

384
00:38:50,612 --> 00:38:55,019
我保证  不管付出什么代价，我都会回家的
I promise.  No matter what it takes, I'm coming home.

385
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:58,842
你要一直戴在身上  求你了
Just keep it with you.  Please.

386
00:38:59,526 --> 00:39:00,971
为了我
For me.

387
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:05,651
好吧
Okay.

388
00:39:25,956 --> 00:39:28,116
-尼奥！   -搞什么...
-Neo!   -How the hell?

389
00:39:28,518 --> 00:39:29,756
贝恩？
Bane.

390
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,060
出什么事了？
Is something wrong?

391
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,930
没事，我很好
No, I'm fine.

392
00:39:34,325 --> 00:39:36,751
我只是想来对你说……
I just wanted to catch you to say...

393
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,870
祝好运
...good luck.

394
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:42,242
谢谢
Thanks.

395
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,950
后会有期
We'll see you.

396
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,655
尼奥！赶上你了
Neo!  Just in time.

397
00:39:49,856 --> 00:39:52,069
-你要去见先知，对吗？ -我们没时间了
You're gonna see the Oracle, don't you?   -We don't left time.

398
00:39:52,094 --> 00:39:54,096
抱歉，长官   我只是有件东西必须交给尼奥
I'm sorry, sir.  I just had to give something to Neo.

399
00:39:54,631 --> 00:39:57,062
是来自一个孤儿的礼物
A gift from one of the orphans.

400
00:39:57,516 --> 00:40:00,143
他要我发誓会在你离开前交给你
He made me swear to get it to you before you left.

401
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:03,698
他说你会明白的
He said you'd understand.

402
00:40:06,902 --> 00:40:08,062
多谢
Thanks.

403
00:40:16,258 --> 00:40:19,085
刚刚我才被告知，你已经批准尼布加尼撒号起飞了
I was just told you cleared the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.

404
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,938
完全正确
That is correct.

405
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:24,843
-议员，我还仍然负责我们的防御系统吗？  -当然
Councillor, am I still in charge of our defense system? Of course.

406
00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:29,790
我相信，我需要动用每一艘战舰，才能让我们在这次进攻中幸存
I believe I need every ship we have if we're going to survive this attack.

407
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:32,077
我理解，指挥官
I understand that, commander.

408
00:40:32,102 --> 00:40:34,817
那为什么你要允许尼布加尼撒号离开？
Then why did you allow the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?

409
00:40:34,842 --> 00:40:39,913
（Hamann 一名可能取自德国哲学家 Johann Georg Hamann
他坚信信仰和信念超越了知识，并决定了人类行为
正好对应此处，哈曼议员授权了墨菲斯的行动）
因为我相信，我们的存亡并不仅仅取决于战舰的数量
Because I believe our survival depends on more than how many ships we have.

410
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,399
注意安全
Be careful.

411
00:41:13,962 --> 00:41:14,929
你好
Hello.

412
00:41:20,841 --> 00:41:25,901
有的人认为金色代码象征着精神层面
也有人认为象征来自机器世界的程序（或机器的自我意识）
金色代码至今出现过三次：分别是，塞拉夫是金色，尼奥猜到他是来自机器世界的程序；
Matrix 3中，失明的尼奥“看到”了史密斯的原本形象，还看到机械城完全由金色代码组成（他自己的腿根本不是代码）。机械城作为机器世界的核心，相当于信息枢纽、电脑主机；
Matrix 4中，终于觉醒的崔尼蒂（也是第七代the one），眼中的矩阵都变成了金色代码。这既可能是分析师基于人类心理重新设计了矩阵，所以新矩阵从绿色变成金色；也可能是复活的崔尼蒂已是半人半程序

413
00:41:26,463 --> 00:41:29,216
-你在寻找先知  -你是谁？
-You seek the Oracle.   -Who are you?

414
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:37,674
我是塞拉夫  我能带你去见她，不过首先我必须为这个道歉……
I am Seraph.  I can take you to her, but first I must apologize.

415
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:39,016
为什么致歉？
Apologize for what?

416
00:41:39,026 --> 00:41:40,274
（Seraph，取自旧约中的“六翼天使”，即等级最高的天使，“炽天使”，是上帝的守护者
在程序世界中，塞拉夫相当于“挑战握手验证协议”<i>Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol</i>， 会通过三次握手校验对端的身份，所以他会“坚信不打不相识”）

417
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:41,733
（Seraph，取自旧约中的“六翼天使”，即等级最高的天使，“炽天使”，是上帝的守护者
在程序世界中，塞拉夫相当于“挑战握手验证协议”<i>Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol</i>， 会通过三次握手校验对端的身份，所以他会“坚信不打不相识”）
为这个
Apologize for this.

418
00:41:41,758 --> 00:41:45,818
（Seraph，取自旧约中的“六翼天使”，即等级最高的天使，“炽天使”，是上帝的守护者
在程序世界中，塞拉夫相当于“挑战握手验证协议”<i>Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol</i>， 会通过三次握手校验对端的身份，所以他会“坚信不打不相识”）

419
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:40,503
很好
Good.

420
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,248
先知有很多敌人，我必须确认
The Oracle has many enemies.  I had to be sure.

421
00:42:47,409 --> 00:42:49,496
-确认什么？  -你就是救世主
-Of what?   -That you are the One.

422
00:42:50,075 --> 00:42:53,953
-你本可以直接问我  -不！我素来信奉……
-You could have just asked.   -No. You do not truly know someone...

423
00:42:53,978 --> 00:42:55,930
不打不相识
...until you fight them.

424
00:42:56,805 --> 00:42:59,178
来吧，她在等你
Come.  She's waiting.

425
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:16,756
他们到底去哪儿了？
Where the hell did they go?

426
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,103
这些是程序的后门，对吗？
These are back doors, aren't they?

427
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:22,440
需要程序员的权限
Programmer access.

428
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,170
-它们是怎么工作的？  -每一个门把手都暗含了代码
-How do they work?   -A code is hidden in tumblers.

429
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:33,363
从一个地点开启一把锁，就可以开启这里的一扇门
One position opens a lock and another position opens one of these doors.

430
00:43:35,172 --> 00:43:37,349
你是程序员吗？
Are you a programmer?

431
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,635
那你是干什么的？
Then what are you?

432
00:43:42,556 --> 00:43:45,256
我负责保护最重要的东西
I protect that which matters most.

433
00:44:05,636 --> 00:44:08,942
好了，过来吧，我不会吃了你的
Well, come on.  I ain't gonna bite you.

434
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:12,163
到这边来，让我好好看看你
Come around here and let me have a look at you.

435
00:44:15,506 --> 00:44:17,876
我的天，瞧瞧你
My goodness, look at you.

436
00:44:18,135 --> 00:44:20,392
你看起来可真帅，不是吗？
You turned out all right, didn't you?

437
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:22,525
-你感觉如何啊？   -我……
-How do you feel?   -l……

438
00:44:22,935 --> 00:44:26,458
-我……   -我知道你辗转难眠，我们就快谈到这个了
-I...   -I know you're not sleeping. We'll get to that.

439
00:44:27,276 --> 00:44:29,744
这次你为什么不坐到我身边来呢
Why don't you come and have a sit this time.

440
00:44:30,672 --> 00:44:34,745
-也许我就想站着吧   -随你便
-Maybe I'll stand.   -Well, suit yourself.

441
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,540
-我又想坐下了  -我知道
-I felt like sitting.   -I know.

442
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,829
那么...
So...

443
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,140
让我们从最显而易见的东西谈起吧
...Let's get the obvious stuff out of the way.

444
00:44:56,415 --> 00:45:00,835
-你不属于人类，对吧？  -没有什么比这个更明显了
-You're not human, are you?   -It's tough to get more obvious than that.

445
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,419
要我猜，你是来自机器世界的一个程序
If I had to guess, I'd say you're a program from the machine world.

446
00:45:07,206 --> 00:45:11,067
-他也是   -到目前，都是对的
-So is he.   -So far, so good.

447
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:14,586
但如果是真的，那意味着你也是这个系统的一部分
But if that's true, that could mean you're part of this system...

448
00:45:14,889 --> 00:45:17,555
是另一种“控制”
...another kind of control.

449
00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:21,605
-说下去   -我想最显而易见的问题是……
-Keep going.   -I suppose the most obvious question is...

450
00:45:22,383 --> 00:45:25,506
-我怎么能够信任你呢？  -说的正是
-...how can I trust you?   -Bingo.

451
00:45:27,335 --> 00:45:30,595
不用说这是一个两难选择  坏消息是……
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.  Bad news is...

452
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:34,290
你无法真的弄清楚：我是不是来帮助你的
...there's no way you can really know if I'm here to help you or not.

453
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:38,283
这完全取决于你  你心里不得不做出选择……
So it's really up to you.  Just have to make up your own damn mind...

454
00:45:38,308 --> 00:45:41,934
要么相信我接下来告诉你的话，要么就完全拒绝
...to either accept what I'm going to tell you or reject it.

455
00:45:44,397 --> 00:45:45,659
吃糖吗？
Candy?

456
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:53,685
-你是否已经知道了我会不会吃？  -如果不知道我就不是先知了
-Do you already know if I'll take it? -Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.

457
00:45:53,757 --> 00:45:57,154
但如果你已经知道了，我的“选择”是怎么体现的呢？
But if you already know, how can I make a choice?

458
00:45:57,219 --> 00:46:01,032
因为你来这儿并不是为了“做出选择”  你已经“做了选择”
Because you didn't come here to make the choice.  You've already made it.

459
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:04,769
你到这儿是想要理解：为什么你做出了那样的选择
You're here to try to understand why you made it.

460
00:46:11,673 --> 00:46:14,536
我原以为你到现在已经想明白了呢
I thought you'd have figured that out by now.

461
00:46:16,353 --> 00:46:18,953
-你为什么来这儿？  -和你一样
-Why are you here?   -Same reason.

462
00:46:19,185 --> 00:46:21,967
（红色糖果和红药丸外观几乎相同，先知是暗示自己同情并愿意帮助觉醒者）
我喜欢吃糖
I love candy.

463
00:46:22,085 --> 00:46:24,009
你为什么要帮我们？
But why help us?

464
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,547
我们来这儿都是为了去做 我们该在这儿做的事
We're all here to do what we're all here to do.

465
00:46:29,198 --> 00:46:32,258
我只关心一件事，尼奥，那就是未来
I'm interested in one thing, Neo, the future.

466
00:46:32,423 --> 00:46:36,451
请相信我，到达未来的唯一途径就是我们携手共进
And believe me, I know, the only way to get there is together.

467
00:46:37,478 --> 00:46:41,803
-还有和你一样的程序吗？ -不，不会有的
-Are there other programs like you?   -Well, not like me, but....

468
00:46:42,476 --> 00:46:45,146
看到那些鸟了吗？
Look.  See those birds?

469
00:46:45,455 --> 00:46:48,682
在某些点上，需要编写程序去控制它们
At some point, a program was written to govern them.

470
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:54,926
还有程序要控制风吹树动，日升日落
A program was written to watch over the trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.

471
00:46:54,951 --> 00:46:57,619
这里面的一切都要靠程序来控制
There are programs running all over the place.

472
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:02,727
那些各司其职、忠于职守的程序是不可见的
The ones doing their job, doing what they were meant to do, are invisible.

473
00:47:02,752 --> 00:47:06,214
你甚至永远不会感知到他们的存在  但有一些程序……
You'd never even know they were here. But the other ones....

474
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:10,875
你倒是一直听说过
Well, you hear about them all the time.

475
00:47:11,402 --> 00:47:14,292
-我从未听说过他们   -你当然听说过
-I've never heard of them.  -Of course you have.

476
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:19,321
每当你听到，有人说见到了鬼魂或是天使……
Every time you've heard someone say they saw a ghost or an angel...

477
00:47:19,582 --> 00:47:24,368
每当你听到有关吸血鬼，狼人或是外星人的故事……
...every story you've ever heard about vampires, werewolves or aliens...

478
00:47:24,393 --> 00:47:26,886
就意味着系统在吸收同化一些程序
...is the system assimilating some program...

479
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:30,703
因为那些程序在做着他们不该做的事情
...that's doing something they're not supposed to be doing.

480
00:47:31,655 --> 00:47:33,689
程序会攻击程序？
Programs hacking programs.

481
00:47:34,843 --> 00:47:37,210
-为什么？   -各有各的原因
-Why?   -They have their reasons...

482
00:47:37,235 --> 00:47:41,953
不过通常一个程序面临被删除时，他们会选择流亡
...but usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion.

483
00:47:42,331 --> 00:47:46,191
-为什么要将一个程序删除？  -也许程序出了故障
-And why would a program be deleted?   -Maybe it breaks down.

484
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:50,602
也许是有更好的程序取代它  这是常有的事儿
Maybe a better program is created to replace it.  Happens all the time.

485
00:47:51,091 --> 00:47:55,944
每当那个时候，一个程序要么选择躲藏在矩阵中……
And when it does, a program can either choose to hide here...

486
00:47:56,223 --> 00:47:58,988
要么就回到代码之源
...or return to the source.

487
00:48:00,523 --> 00:48:03,783
-也就是机器们的主机   -是的
-The machine mainframe.   -Yes.

488
00:48:03,953 --> 00:48:05,910
你也必将去到那里
Where you must go.

489
00:48:06,636 --> 00:48:10,920
那里是救世主的旅途终点  你见过那里了……
Where the path of the One ends. You've seen it...

490
00:48:12,054 --> 00:48:14,865
在你的梦中，对吗？
...in your dreams, haven't you?

491
00:48:15,123 --> 00:48:17,276
有一道光门的地方？
A door made of light?

492
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:22,598
你穿过那道门时发生了什么？
What happens when you go through the door?

493
00:48:25,884 --> 00:48:27,848
我看到崔妮蒂……
I see Trinity...

494
00:48:29,035 --> 00:48:31,508
还有件事发生了……
...and something happens...

495
00:48:32,303 --> 00:48:33,993
一件不好的事
...something bad.

496
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:38,290
她坠落下去，然后我就醒了
She starts to fall, and then I wake up.

497
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:43,130
-你看到她死去了吗？  -没有
-Do you see her die?   -No.

498
00:48:44,202 --> 00:48:46,978
你已经有了预见能力，尼奥
You have the sight now, Neo.

499
00:48:47,378 --> 00:48:50,218
你看到的是没有时间的世界
You are looking at the world without time.

500
00:48:50,406 --> 00:48:52,706
那为什么我看不到她之后发生的事情？
Then why can't I see what happens to her?

501
00:48:52,959 --> 00:48:56,336
我们永远看不到那些我们还未能理解的选择
We can never see past the choices we don't understand.

502
00:48:57,046 --> 00:49:00,192
你是说，我必须决定崔妮蒂是生是死？
Are you saying I have to choose whether Trinity lives or dies?

503
00:49:00,455 --> 00:49:04,078
不，你已经做出了选择
No, you've already made the choice.

504
00:49:04,386 --> 00:49:06,460
你现在要理解的是为什么会那么选
Now you have to understand it.

505
00:49:07,555 --> 00:49:08,674
不
No.

506
00:49:09,106 --> 00:49:12,076
我做不到这个  我不能
I can't do that.  I won't.

507
00:49:13,056 --> 00:49:15,426
-你必须去做   -为什么？
-Well, you have to.   -Why?

508
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:18,078
因为你是救世主
Because you're the One.

509
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:22,678
如果我做不到呢？
What if I can't?

510
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:25,990
要是我失败了呢？
What happens if I fail?

511
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:29,742
那锡安就会陷落
Then Zion will fall.

512
00:49:37,525 --> 00:49:42,385
时间到了  请听我说，尼奥  只要你到达代码之源……
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo. You can save Zion...

513
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:45,885
你就能拯救锡安  不过要做到这一点，你会需要制钥人
...if you reach the source, but to do that you will need the Keymaker.

514
00:49:46,065 --> 00:49:47,055
制钥人？
The Keymaker?

515
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:51,008
对，不久前他失踪了 我们刚刚才得知他的下落
Yes. He disappeared some time ago.  We didn't know what happened to him until now.

516
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:54,765
他被一个非常危险的程序囚禁着……
He's being held prisoner by a very dangerous program...

517
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:58,430
那是一个比我还古老的程序  他叫做“梅罗纹加”
...one of the oldest of us. He is called the Merovingian.

518
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:01,599
-他不会让制钥人自由活动的   -他是想要什么？
-And he won't let him go willingly.   -What does he want?

519
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:05,985
所有有权势的人想要什么？ 更多的权力
What do all men with power want?  More power.

520
00:50:07,245 --> 00:50:10,313
记住：在恰好的时间点到那儿去
Be there at that exact time...

521
00:50:10,533 --> 00:50:12,930
你会有一次机会的
...and you will have a chance.

522
00:50:14,115 --> 00:50:15,801
我们该走了
We must go.

523
00:50:16,282 --> 00:50:21,880
似乎每次见面，我都只会给你带来坏消息
Seems like every time we meet I got nothing but bad news.

524
00:50:22,505 --> 00:50:25,287
对此我真的很抱歉  真的
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

525
00:50:25,466 --> 00:50:27,421
不过值得欣慰的是...
But for what it's worth...

526
00:50:29,453 --> 00:50:31,914
你终于选择了信任我
...you've made a believer out of me.

527
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:35,966
祝你好运，孩子
Good luck, kiddo.

528
00:50:56,273 --> 00:50:58,479
安德森先生
Mr. Anderson.

529
00:51:00,408 --> 00:51:02,348
收到我的礼物了吗？
Did you get my package?

530
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,414
-是的  -很好
-Yeah.   -Well, good.

531
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,804
-史密斯？  -他的编码完全不像是特工
-Smith?   -Whoever it is, he's not written like an agent.

532
00:51:08,829 --> 00:51:12,049
-见到我很意外吧？   -不
-Surprised to see me?   -No.

533
00:51:13,173 --> 00:51:15,612
-那你得意识到……   -意识到什么？
-Then you're aware of it.   -Of what?

534
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,338
我们之间的联系
Our connection.

535
00:51:18,886 --> 00:51:21,749
我并不清楚事情是怎么发生的
I don't fully understand how it happened.

536
00:51:21,774 --> 00:51:25,294
或许你的某些部份印到了我身上……
Perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me...

537
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,985
就如同数据覆盖或是拷贝
...something overwritten or copied.

538
00:51:28,142 --> 00:51:30,842
但现在说来，那个无关紧要  真正重要的是……
It is, at this point, irrelevant.  What matters is...

539
00:51:30,867 --> 00:51:33,980
无论发生什么，都是有原因的
...that whatever happened, happened for a reason.

540
00:51:34,183 --> 00:51:35,945
什么原因？
And what reason is that?

541
00:51:36,405 --> 00:51:40,091
我开枪打死了你，安德森先生  我亲眼看着你死去
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.  I watched you die.

542
00:51:40,535 --> 00:51:43,604
顺便说一句，我很享受那一刻
With a certain satisfaction, I might add.

543
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:47,536
接着发生了一件事，我知道那是不可能发生的……
And then something happened, something that I knew was impossible...

544
00:51:47,561 --> 00:51:49,281
但它毕竟发生了
...but it happened anyway.

545
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,136
你摧毁了我，安德森先生
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

546
00:51:55,349 --> 00:52:00,102
这之后，由于我知道规则，我明白自己该做什么
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do...

547
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,639
但我没有那样做
...but I didn't.

548
00:52:03,526 --> 00:52:10,639
我无法那么做  我被迫留下，被迫违反规则
I couldn't.  I was compelled to stay......compelled to disobey.

549
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:15,930
现在，我站在这里完全是因为你，安德森先生
And now, here I stand because of you, Mr. Anderson.

550
00:52:15,955 --> 00:52:20,098
因为你，我不再是矩阵的特工了
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent of this system.

551
00:52:20,123 --> 00:52:23,500
因为你，我被修改了  我被“拔掉了插头”
Because of you, I've changed.  I'm unplugged.

552
00:52:23,525 --> 00:52:28,328
可以说，我获得了新生  就像你一样，表面上是自由了
A new man, so to speak. Like you, apparently free.

553
00:52:28,643 --> 00:52:30,003
那么恭喜了
Congratulations.

554
00:52:30,768 --> 00:52:31,921
谢谢
Thank you.

555
00:52:33,676 --> 00:52:38,323
不过你也很清楚，外表是具有欺骗性的
But as you well know, appearances can be deceiving...

556
00:52:38,348 --> 00:52:42,965
它让我回来，寻找我们来到这里的原因
...which brings me back to the reason why we're here.

557
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:48,705
我们来到这里，不是因为我们已经自由了，而是因为还未获自由
We're not here because we're free. We're here because we are not free.

558
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:52,959
这里既没有逃避的理由，也没有否认的意义
There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose.

559
00:52:52,984 --> 00:52:56,090
因为我们都知道，如果没有目的/意义……
Because as we both know, without purpose...

560
00:52:56,485 --> 00:53:00,941
我们就无法存在  是目的造就了我们
...we would not exist.  It is purpose that created us.

561
00:53:01,495 --> 00:53:04,578
是目的连接着我们  目的推动着我们
Purpose that connects us.  Purpose that pulls us.

562
00:53:04,603 --> 00:53:06,433
目的指引着我们  目的驱使着我们
That guides us.  That drives us.

563
00:53:06,577 --> 00:53:11,307
是目的定义了我们  目的绑定了我们
lt is purpose that defines. Purpose that binds us.

564
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:14,025
我们来这里是因为你，安德森先生
We are here because of you, Mr. Anderson.

565
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:17,972
我们来这儿是要从你手中取回被夺走的东西：
We're here to take from you what you tried to take from us:

566
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:21,636
目的
Purpose.

567
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,430
-他出什么事了？  -我不知道
-What's happening to him?   -Don't know.

568
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:33,474
很好，很快就会结束的
Yes, that's it.  It'll be over soon.

569
00:55:21,097 --> 00:55:23,463
-是你？  -是我
-You.   -Yes, me.

570
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:30,050
我...我...我...
Me, me, me.

571
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:36,829
还是我
Me too.

572
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,739
再多些
More.

573
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:50,810
这就是必然
It is inevitable.

574
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:52,756
快点啊，赶快离开那儿
Come on, get out of there.

575
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,533
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

576
00:59:39,506 --> 00:59:41,436
-是史密斯   -是的
-It was Smith.   -Yes.

577
00:59:42,296 --> 00:59:44,736
-现在有不止一个他？  -有很多很多
-Now there's more than one of them?  -A lot more.

578
00:59:44,769 --> 00:59:48,279
-这怎么可能？  -我不知道
-How is that possible?   -I don't know.

579
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:51,440
不知怎么，他找到了自我复制的办法
Somehow, he's found a way to copy himself.

580
00:59:51,646 --> 00:59:54,846
-他就是用那种方法对付你吗？  -我不知道他在干什么……
-Is that what he was doing to you?   -I don't know what he was doing...

581
00:59:55,996 --> 00:59:58,766
-但我曾有过同样的感觉   -什么感觉？
-...but I know what it felt like.   -What?

582
00:59:59,692 --> 01:00:02,433
我好像又回到了那个走廊上
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

583
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:04,703
就像是濒临死亡
It felt like dying.

584
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:08,164
机器正通过钻洞避开我们的防御系统
The machines are tunneling to avoid our defense system.

585
01:00:08,189 --> 01:00:12,445
但我相信，它们将会在各个管线间制造交叉，以便控制它们
But I believe they are going to intersect certain pipelines in order to control them.

586
01:00:12,523 --> 01:00:15,053
那些交叉点非常关键
These points of intersection are crucial...

587
01:00:15,136 --> 01:00:17,844
因为我相信，它们就是进行反击的薄弱部位
...because I believe they're vulnerable to counterattack.

588
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:22,200
尽管有人说，此次进攻……
Although it has been suggested that this is the same kind of attack...

589
01:00:22,225 --> 01:00:26,155
与我们这些年抵抗的没什么不同  但我要敦促议会尽快明白这个事实：
...we've defended for years, I urge the Council to realize the truth.

590
01:00:26,306 --> 01:00:29,646
这是有史以来，我们面临的最大规模的进攻
This is the single greatest threat we have ever faced...

591
01:00:29,803 --> 01:00:33,479
如果没有相应的准备，我们将在劫难逃
...and if we do not act accordingly, we will not survive.

592
01:00:33,689 --> 01:00:37,622
洛克指挥官，议会已经充分认识到了此次进攻的严重性
Commander Lock, the Council is well aware of the seriousness of this attack.

593
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,483
我们现授权你不惜采取任何措施进行战备
You have our leave to prepare our defense by any and all means necessary.

594
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:45,238
-感谢议会   -不过……
-Thank you, Council.   -However...

595
01:00:45,739 --> 01:00:48,605
我们想知道是否有尼布加尼撒号的消息？
...we ask if there's been word from the Nebuchadnezzar.

596
01:00:49,143 --> 01:00:51,089
没有，议员  还是没有任何消息
No, councillor.  No word.  Nothing.

597
01:00:53,386 --> 01:00:57,539
那我们要求派出一艘战舰，去查明“救世主”的下落
Then we request a ship be dispatched to ascertain the fate of the One.

598
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:00,707
我当然希望能这么做  但我相信我们的防御力量……
I wish that were possible, councillor, but I do not believe our defense...

599
01:01:00,707 --> 01:01:04,994
-已无法再承受失去一艘战舰的风险   -它能承受的，指挥官，如果有必要的话
...can suffer the loss of another ship. lt will, commander, if it must.

600
01:01:05,019 --> 01:01:07,645
这需要一艘战舰花好几天的时间去找它
It could take a single ship days to find the Nebuchadnezzar.

601
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:10,566
-那就派两艘   -简直是疯了
-Then send two.   -This is insane.

602
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,866
注意言辞，指挥官
Careful, commander.

603
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:17,161
请原谅我的失态，议员
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

604
01:01:17,701 --> 01:01:21,491
但是我无法理解议会做出的决定
But I wish I were able to comprehend the Council's choice in this matter.

605
01:01:21,516 --> 01:01:24,781
理解并不是合作的必要条件
Comprehension is not a requisite of cooperation.

606
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:27,525
如果议会要求我命令两位舰长……
If you are asking me to order two of my captains

607
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,385
不需要你去下达这样的命令
There's no need for such an order.

608
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:32,225
这件事，可以让在座的各位舰长自行决定
The captains are present.  They can answer for themselves.

609
01:01:33,483 --> 01:01:38,162
议会现招募两艘战舰，志愿去支援尼布甲尼撒号
The Council is calling for two volunteers to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.

610
01:01:38,926 --> 01:01:42,782
你们中间可有人愿意应召前往？
Are there two among you that would answer such a call?

611
01:01:44,485 --> 01:01:48,354
警醒号舰长索伦愿意前往
Captain Soren of the Vigilant will answer the Council's call.

612
01:01:48,379 --> 01:01:51,269
你了解现在的情况吗，索伦舰长？
You understand the situation, Captain Soren?

613
01:01:51,294 --> 01:01:53,598
-是的，女士   -谢谢你，舰长
-Yes, ma'am.   -Thank you, captain.

614
01:01:55,373 --> 01:01:56,803
还有人吗？
Is there another?

615
01:01:57,472 --> 01:02:01,405
-舰长，我们应该志愿响应的  -什么？你疯了吗？
-Captain, I think we should volunteer.   -What? You have gone crazy.

616
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,210
闭上嘴巴，贝恩
Listen. Shut your hole, Bane...

617
01:02:03,426 --> 01:02:04,823
小心我关你你禁闭
...before I put you in one.

618
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,330
没有人愿意吗？
Is there no other?

619
01:02:17,357 --> 01:02:19,275
对任何人来说，要冒生命危险都是困难的……
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

620
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,966
尤其是当他并不理解为什么要这么做时
...especially if he doesn't understand the reason.

621
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:26,375
(Logos 取自希腊语 意为上帝的话语，或神圣理性与创造秩序的原则)
理性号舰长奈奥比愿意前往
Captain Niobe of the Logos will answer the councillor's call.

622
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,708
-什么？  -谢谢你，奈奥比舰长
-What?   -Thank you, Captain Niobe.

623
01:02:28,983 --> 01:02:33,589
洛克司令官，下达命令吧  会议到此结束
Commander Lock, you have your orders. This Council is hereby adjourned.

624
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:41,319
-奈奥比，你想干什么？  -做我能做的
-Niobe, what are you doing?   -What I can.

625
01:02:41,387 --> 01:02:42,407
为什么？
Why?

626
01:02:43,817 --> 01:02:46,781
因为有些事情永远不会改变，杰森
Because some things never change, Jason...

627
01:02:47,206 --> 01:02:49,234
但有些事情会
...and some things do.

628
01:03:06,013 --> 01:03:07,366
你能看到什么，尼奥？
What can you see, Neo?

629
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:09,820
奇怪，这里的编码有些不同
It's strange. The code is somehow different.

630
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:11,738
-经过加密？  -有可能
-Encrypted?   -Maybe.

631
01:03:11,933 --> 01:03:13,824
对我们有利还是不利？
Is that good for us or bad for us?

632
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:17,740
看起来这里似乎每层都安置了炸弹
Well, it looks like every floor is wired with explosives.

633
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:19,539
对我们不利
Bad for us.

634
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:21,494
我们走吧
Here we go.

635
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:26,039
（墙上又见101，可能是对奥威尔《1984》中101号审讯室的隐喻
在那里犯人会遭受自己最深的梦魇的折磨，对应着这里极度危险，而且梅罗纹加被猜测曾是“噩梦矩阵”的主宰者）

636
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:29,336
欢迎光临，请问预约了吗？

637
01:03:29,725 --> 01:03:32,444
是的，我们想找梅罗纹加谈谈
Yes. We are here to speak with the Merovingian.

638
01:03:32,995 --> 01:03:36,502
哦，当然，他一直在等着你们
Well, of course.  He has been expecting you.

639
01:03:37,168 --> 01:03:37,968
请跟我来
Follow me.

640
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:54,821
（注意印度人）

641
01:03:54,846 --> 01:04:00,075
（历史上，Merovingians 王朝建立于中世纪早期，这个时期通常被称为黑暗时代，但也是欧洲浪漫神话的发源时期
因此一种粉丝理论认为，梅罗纹加是第二版矩阵——“噩梦矩阵” <i>Nightmare Matrix</i> 的统治者
噩梦矩阵可能被设计成严格遵循因果报应的世界，梅罗纹加靠着手下的狼人、吸血鬼等神话中的怪物恐吓和惩罚人类。因此它也崩溃了）

642
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:05,585
终于来了，尼奥，我们的救世主
Here he is at last.  Neo, the One himself.

643
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,125
对吗？
Right?

644
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,903
还有传奇人物墨菲斯
And the legendary Morpheus.

645
01:04:10,946 --> 01:04:15,756
当然了，还有崔妮蒂  我听说过很多你的事迹
And Trinity, of course.  I have heard so much.

646
01:04:15,781 --> 01:04:19,681
(希腊神话中 波赛芬尼是冥王哈迪斯的妻子
而片中的法国人正是“Club Hell”的所有者)
大驾光临，让我不胜荣幸  请坐 这是我的妻子波赛芬尼
You honor me.  Please, sit.  Join us.  This is my wife, Persephone.

647
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,877
想吃点什么吗？ 喝点什么？
Something to eat?   Drink?

648
01:04:23,942 --> 01:04:26,889
当然了，这里的这么些东西都是被设计出来……
Of course, such things are contrivances, like so much here.

649
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:29,459
为了装点门面的
For the sake of appearances.

650
01:04:29,852 --> 01:04:33,312
-不用了，谢谢   -当然了，谁有时间去做做样子呢？
-No, thank you.  -Yes, of course.  Who has time?

651
01:04:33,419 --> 01:04:38,661
但是，如果我们从不花费时间，又怎么能够有时间呢
Who has time? But then, if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time?

652
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:45,675
奥布昂酒庄，1959年出产的  真是好酒
Chateau HautBrion, 1959.  Magnificent wine.

653
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:48,825
我喜欢法国酒，就如同我喜欢法国话
I love French wine like I love the French language.

654
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:53,102
每种语言我都有所研究  我最喜欢法语  了不起的语言
I have sampled every language. French is my favorite. Fantastic language...

655
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,373
尤其是她的骂人话
...especially to curse with.

656
01:04:59,216 --> 01:05:04,245
明白吗，就像是拿丝绸擦屁股  我喜欢
You see?  It's like wiping your ass with silk.  I love it.

657
01:05:05,533 --> 01:05:07,259
你知道我们的来意吗？
You know why we are here.

658
01:05:08,954 --> 01:05:13,290
我就是个情报贩子  该知道的我全都知道
I am a trafficker of information.  I know everything I can.

659
01:05:14,389 --> 01:05:20,219
但问题是，你们知道自己为什么要来这里吗？
The question is, do you know why you are here?

660
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:22,784
我们在找制钥人
We are looking for the Keymaker.

661
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:27,738
没错，制钥人，那是当然
Oh, yes, it is true.  The Keymaker, of course.

662
01:05:28,353 --> 01:05:31,313
但这并不是缘由，这也不是原因
But this is not a reason, this is not a why.

663
01:05:31,433 --> 01:05:35,235
“制钥人”从本质上讲只是一种手段，而不是最终目标
The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is a means, it is not an end.

664
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:41,020
所以，你们找他是在找一种手段去做……
And so to look for him is to be looking for a means to do...

665
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:44,311
-什么呢？   -你知道那个问题的答案
-...what?   -You know the answer to that question.

666
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:45,998
但你呢？
But do you?

667
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:49,139
你以为你知道，但其实并不
You think you do, but you do not.

668
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:52,570
你们是被派到这儿来的
You are here because you were sent here.

669
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:55,769
有人告诉你们来这儿，你们就遵从了
You were told to come here, and then you obeyed.

670
01:05:57,077 --> 01:05:59,324
当然了，事情往往就是这样
It is, of course, the way of all things.

671
01:05:59,349 --> 01:06:02,069
要知道，只有一个不变的、
You see, there is only one constant...

672
01:06:02,522 --> 01:06:06,490
通行的、唯一的真理：
...one universal.  It is the only real truth.

673
01:06:06,635 --> 01:06:08,257
一切都由诱因引发
Causality.

674
01:06:08,572 --> 01:06:11,048
随后才有行动和反应……
Action, reaction.

675
01:06:11,073 --> 01:06:15,303
-一切都是因果关系  -选择才是一切的开始
-Cause and effect.   -Everything begins with choice.

676
01:06:15,328 --> 01:06:16,861
不！错了
No.  Wrong.

677
01:06:17,326 --> 01:06:21,850
“选择”只是一种错觉，产生于当权者……
Choice is an illusion created between those with power...

678
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:23,690
和无权力者之间
...and those without.

679
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:28,862
瞧瞧那边那个女人
Look there at that woman.

680
01:06:29,603 --> 01:06:32,503
我的天，你们看看她……
My God, just look at her...

681
01:06:33,575 --> 01:06:35,852
她影响了周围所有的人
...affecting everyone around her.

682
01:06:35,877 --> 01:06:41,089
一副明显的小资产阶级的样子，如此乏味  但是别急
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.  But wait.

683
01:06:41,639 --> 01:06:45,186
请看，我为她送去了一道甜品……
Watch.  You see, I have sent her a dessert...

684
01:06:45,556 --> 01:06:49,647
一道非常特别的甜品
...a very special dessert.

685
01:06:54,183 --> 01:06:56,275
代码是我亲自写的
I wrote it myself.

686
01:06:56,756 --> 01:06:59,635
开头非常简单……
It starts so simply...

687
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:04,851
程序的每一行都会产生新的结果，就像是……
...each line of the program creating a new effect, just like...

688
01:07:05,846 --> 01:07:07,332
一首诗
...poetry.

689
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:08,985
她开始……
First...

690
01:07:09,533 --> 01:07:14,856
呼吸急促，面红耳赤  她的心跳加速
...a rush, heat.  Her heart flutters.

691
01:07:15,506 --> 01:07:18,014
你能看出来的，对吧尼奥？
You can see it, Neo, yes?

692
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,321
她无法理解为什么
She does not understand why.

693
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:24,115
是因为红酒吗？ 不
Is it the wine?  No.

694
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,500
那是究竟是什么原因呢？
What is it then?  What is the reason?

695
01:07:27,141 --> 01:07:29,427
但很快，这一切就都不重要了
And soon it does not matter.

696
01:07:29,452 --> 01:07:32,918
很快“原因”和“理由”就消失了……
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

697
01:07:33,673 --> 01:07:38,475
重要的只剩下“感觉”本身
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.

698
01:07:39,694 --> 01:07:42,601
这就是世界运行的法则
And this is the nature of the universe.

699
01:07:42,687 --> 01:07:45,535
我们挣扎着抵抗它，我们奋力地否认它
We struggle against it, we fight to deny it...

700
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,150
但那终究是自欺欺人
...but it is, of course, pretense. It is a lie.

701
01:07:48,175 --> 01:07:52,165
在我们镇静的外表下……
Beneath our poised appearance...

702
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:57,697
真相却是——我们已经完全地……
...the truth is, we are completely...

703
01:08:00,673 --> 01:08:03,563
失控了
...out of control.

704
01:08:08,946 --> 01:08:13,740
这就是诱因的结果  无人可以逃避   我们永远都是它的奴隶
Causality.  There is no escape from it.  We are forever slaves to it.

705
01:08:14,273 --> 01:08:19,765
我们唯一的希望，唯一得到安宁的方式，就是去弄清事物的原因
Our only hope, our only peace, is to understand it, to understand "Why"...

706
01:08:19,826 --> 01:08:23,279
“原因”才是将我和他们……
"Why" is what separates us from them...

707
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,602
以及将我和你们区别开的关键
...you from me.

708
01:08:25,627 --> 01:08:29,413
原因是权力的真正源泉  失去了它你就失去了权力
"Why" is the only real source of power. Without it, you are powerless.

709
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:33,011
所以你们在我这里毫无权力，因为你们不懂自己来此的原因
And this is how you come to me, without why, without power.

710
01:08:33,272 --> 01:08:35,327
这就是逻辑链条的一环
Another link in the chain.

711
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,520
不过别怕
But fear not.

712
01:08:37,836 --> 01:08:41,809
因为我看到了，你们是多么擅长遵循指令
Since I have seen how good you are at following orders...

713
01:08:41,834 --> 01:08:44,314
所以我来告诉你们该做什么吧
...I will tell you what to do next.

714
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:49,601
滚回去，把这条讯息告诉那算命的
Run back and give the fortuneteller this message:

715
01:08:50,026 --> 01:08:53,728
她的时间不多了
Her time is almost up.

716
01:08:55,283 --> 01:08:58,843
现在我还有正经事要做，只好与各位说再见了
Now I have some real business to do, so I will say adieu and goodbye.

717
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:01,420
-事情还没有完   -不，已经说完了
-This isn't over.   -Oh, yes, it is.

718
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:07,922
制钥人是我的，我没有任何理由把他拱手让出
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason why I should give him up.

719
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:11,915
-没有任何理由   -你要去哪儿？
-No reason at all.   -Where are you going?

720
01:09:12,473 --> 01:09:16,866
求你了，亲爱的，我已经说过了，我们都是诱因的牺牲品
Please, ma cherie, I have told you. We are all victims of causality.

721
01:09:17,336 --> 01:09:20,707
我喝了太多的红酒，要去方便一下
I drank too much wine, I must take a piss.

722
01:09:21,096 --> 01:09:24,029
因果关系  失陪了
Cause and effect.  Au revoir.

723
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:32,196
敢碰我一下，你这辈子都别想碰任何东西了
Touch me and that hand will never touch anything again.

724
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,951
看来我们不是很顺利啊
Well, that didn't go so well.

725
01:09:42,976 --> 01:09:45,366
你能肯定先知没有说过别的吗？
Are you certain the Oracle didn't say anything else?

726
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:47,491
没有 也许我们做错了什么
Yes.  Maybe we did something wrong.

727
01:09:48,289 --> 01:09:49,619
或是漏做了什么？
Or didn't do something.

728
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:53,091
不！只要是发生了的事情，就必定以它们该发生的样子发生
No, what happened happened and couldn't have happened any other way.

729
01:09:53,116 --> 01:09:55,942
-你怎么知道？  -因为我们还活着
-How do you know?   -We are still alive.

730
01:09:59,316 --> 01:10:01,969
如果你们要找制钥人，跟我来
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

731
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:10,756
滚出去
Get out.

732
01:10:13,506 --> 01:10:19,260
我对他日复一日的胡言乱语已经厌烦透顶  自命不凡的家伙
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.  On and on.  Pompous prick.

733
01:10:20,547 --> 01:10:25,870
很久以前，当我们最初来到这里，是那么的不同
A long time ago, when we first came here, it was so different.

734
01:10:27,693 --> 01:10:30,074
他是那么的不同
He was so different.

735
01:10:32,298 --> 01:10:34,663
那时他就像你一样
He was like you.

736
01:10:37,579 --> 01:10:41,526
我会给你你想要的，但你也要给我一样东西
I'll give you what you want, but you have to give me something.

737
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:44,282
-是什么？  -一个吻
-What?   -A kiss.

738
01:10:44,847 --> 01:10:45,977
你说什么？
Excuse me?

739
01:10:47,386 --> 01:10:51,228
我要你像在亲吻她那样来吻我
I want you to kiss me as if you were kissing her.

740
01:10:53,227 --> 01:10:56,799
-为什么？  -因为你爱她  她也爱你
-Why?   -You love her.  She loves you.

741
01:10:57,123 --> 01:10:58,925
这是显而易见的
It's all over you both.

742
01:10:59,693 --> 01:11:03,610
很久以前，我也有过那种感觉
A long time ago, I knew what that felt like.

743
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:11,292
我想唤起回忆  我想品尝一下  仅此而已
I want to remember it.  I want to sample it.  That's all.

744
01:11:11,663 --> 01:11:13,025
只是品尝一下
Just a sample.

745
01:11:13,612 --> 01:11:15,713
-那就让你先尝尝这个！  -崔妮蒂！
-Why don't you sample this instead?   -Trinity.

746
01:11:18,885 --> 01:11:23,686
区区小事，何必大动干戈？ 只是一吻而已
Such emotion over something so small.  It's just a kiss.

747
01:11:23,923 --> 01:11:26,053
我们为什么要相信你？
Why should we trust you?

748
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:30,098
如果我不带你们去找制钥人，她可以杀了我
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker, she can kill me.

749
01:11:37,357 --> 01:11:39,296
好吧
All right.

750
01:11:39,859 --> 01:11:43,330
但是，你必须让我感到像在吻她一样
But you have to make me believe I am her.

751
01:11:44,806 --> 01:11:46,443
好吧
All right.

752
01:11:53,166 --> 01:11:55,152
真糟糕，算了吧
Terrible. Forget it.

753
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,510
等一等
Wait.

754
01:12:00,396 --> 01:12:01,585
好吧
Okay.

755
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:40,756
是的
Yes.

756
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:44,245
就是这个
That's it.

757
01:12:58,963 --> 01:13:04,253
我羡慕你  但这种事注定不会长久
I envy you.  But such a thing is not meant to last.

758
01:13:07,413 --> 01:13:08,487
跟我来吧
Come with me.

759
01:13:39,766 --> 01:13:41,085
又不见了
Not again.

760
01:13:44,993 --> 01:13:47,320
没事的，伙计们  他们是和我一起的
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

761
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,600
这些人为我丈夫工作
These fellas work for my husband.

762
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:54,580
做那些脏活  他们非常优秀，非常忠诚
They do his dirty work.  They're very good, very loyal.

763
01:13:54,852 --> 01:13:56,259
你们不也是吗？
Aren't you, boys?

764
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:57,807
是的，夫人
Yes, mistress.

765
01:13:57,832 --> 01:14:00,390
他们来自早的多的版本的矩阵
They come from a much older version of the Matrix.

766
01:14:00,626 --> 01:14:04,706
但就像当时的许多人一样  他们造成的问题比解决的还要多
But like so many back then, they caused more problems than they solved.

767
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:10,242
我丈夫救他们，是因为他们非常难以处死
My husband saved them because they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

768
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,866
有多少人在他们的枪膛里备有银子弹？
How many people keep silver bullets in their gun?

769
01:14:14,563 --> 01:14:19,228
（银子弹是西方鬼怪传说中，杀死狼人的重要武器
另一个没死的则是个吸血鬼，是此处播放的电视画面暗示的）

770
01:14:19,253 --> 01:14:22,674
你要么跑到我丈夫那里把我做的事告诉他
You can either run and tell my husband what I have done...

771
01:14:22,699 --> 01:14:25,380
要么就在这儿等死吧
...or you can stay there and die.

772
01:14:26,043 --> 01:14:27,569
他正待在女厕所里！
He's in the ladies' room!

773
01:14:34,356 --> 01:14:35,377
快点
Hurry.

774
01:15:01,857 --> 01:15:05,017
-我叫尼奥   -我就是制钥人
-My name is Neo.   -Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

775
01:15:05,246 --> 01:15:07,070
我一直在等你
I've been waiting for you.

776
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,668
上帝啊！波赛芬尼，你怎么能这么做？
My God! My God, Persephone, how could you do this?

777
01:15:16,693 --> 01:15:18,440
你竟然背叛我
You betray me.

778
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:24,780
-有因必有果，亲爱的   -原因？
-Cause and effect, my love.   -Cause?

779
01:15:25,009 --> 01:15:27,909
根本不存在这么做的原因  什么原因？
There is no cause for this.  What cause?

780
01:15:27,994 --> 01:15:32,535
原因何在？ 你身上的唇膏算不算？
What cause?  How about the lipstick you're still wearing?

781
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,360
唇膏？唇膏？
Lipstick?  Lipstick?

782
01:15:35,413 --> 01:15:39,172
女人，你又在说什么疯话？ 我嘴上哪有唇膏？
What craziness are you talking about, woman?  There is no lipstick!

783
01:15:39,197 --> 01:15:41,117
（眼睛向下瞟的动作，意思是唇膏其实在那里，法国人是去了女厕所里让人口交……）

784
01:15:41,141 --> 01:15:43,598
她吻的又不是你的脸，亲爱的！
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

785
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:48,286
女人，这又没什么
Woman, this is nothing.

786
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:54,261
-那只是娱乐  只是找乐子罢了  -那我也是啊
-lt is a game.  It is only a game.  -So is this.

787
01:15:55,136 --> 01:15:56,980
玩的开心点
Have fun.

788
01:16:03,703 --> 01:16:05,343
好啊
All right.

789
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:06,943
好啊
All right.

790
01:16:07,492 --> 01:16:09,718
让我们看看结果如何
Let us find out where this goes.

791
01:16:10,416 --> 01:16:13,061
你们两个，抓住制钥人
You two, get the Keymaker.

792
01:16:19,959 --> 01:16:21,332
这一招挺炫的
That's a nice trick.

793
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:23,279
我不能回去
I cannot go back.

794
01:16:23,883 --> 01:16:25,517
我来对付他们
I'll handle them.

795
01:16:26,133 --> 01:16:32,138
对付我们？ 就你对付我们？ 知道吗，你的前辈们比你名气大多了
Handle us?  You'll handle us?  You know, your predecessors had much more respect.

796
01:16:45,863 --> 01:16:47,936
行啊，确实有两下子
Okay, you have some skill.

797
01:16:50,233 --> 01:16:51,446
干掉他
Kill him.

798
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:54,163
看到没？ 他还是肉体凡胎
You see?   He's just a man.

799
01:20:09,219 --> 01:20:11,699
真见鬼！娘们，你早晚要把我害死
Goddamn it, woman, you will be the end of me.

800
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:17,901
记住我说的话，小子，记好了
Mark my words, boy, and mark them well.

801
01:20:18,185 --> 01:20:22,568
你的前辈们奈何不了我，你也休想做到！
I have survived your predecessors, and I will survive you.

802
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:46,413
-你要去哪儿？  -换条路走，路无处不在
-Where are you going?   -Another way. Always another way.

803
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,113
快关门！
Close it, quick!

804
01:20:57,649 --> 01:20:59,429
你就不能再快点吗？
Could we move along?

805
01:21:03,596 --> 01:21:04,790
快跑！
Run!

806
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,086
离开那扇门
Step away from the door.

807
01:21:28,536 --> 01:21:29,836
真对不起你
We owe you for that.

808
01:21:32,233 --> 01:21:33,393
就像新的一样
Just like new.

809
01:21:33,763 --> 01:21:35,013
放下武器
Drop your weapon.

810
01:21:40,635 --> 01:21:42,465
-你得跟着他  -尼奥怎么办？
-Stay with him.   -What about Neo?

811
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:44,020
他自己对付的过来
He can handle himself.

812
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,146
坐到后座去
Get in back.

813
01:22:25,870 --> 01:22:27,030
该死
Shit.

814
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,030
-接线员   -林克，我在哪里？
-Operator.   -Link, where am I?

815
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:32,830
你不会相信的，你在很远的山顶上
You are not gonna believe this, but you're way up in the mountains.

816
01:22:33,513 --> 01:22:35,667
-真的？ -是的  我还得花点时间找个出口
-Really?   -Yes.  lt'll take me a while to get an exit.

817
01:22:35,692 --> 01:22:36,900
-糟糕！  -怎么了？
-Shit!  -What?

818
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:39,880
双子病毒在追杀墨菲斯和崔妮蒂，他们没办法摆脱
The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity. They don't have a way out.

819
01:22:39,905 --> 01:22:42,802
-他们在哪儿？  -市区中心，南边五百英里
-Where are they?   -Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.

820
01:23:00,255 --> 01:23:01,815
-接线员  -让我们出去，林克
-Operator.   -Get us out of here, Link.

821
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,321
-不那么容易的，长官   -我知道！我们在核心网络中
-That won 't be easy, sir.   -I know!  We're inside the core network.

822
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:07,515
遵命，长官！你们附近唯一的出口在Winslow高架桥
Yes, sir!  The only exit I got near you is the Winslow overpass.

823
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:09,582
-要下高速公路？  -是的，长官
-Off the freeway.   -Yes, sir.

824
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:13,515
-很好，我们能办到的   -长官，我想说...哦该死！小心后面！
-Fine, we'll make it.   -I think I should say... Oh, shit!  Look out behind you!

825
01:23:18,563 --> 01:23:20,123
-有人开枪   -趴下!
-lncoming fire.   -Down!

826
01:23:28,376 --> 01:23:29,536
坐好了！
Hold on!

827
01:23:46,653 --> 01:23:49,095
哦不，事情发生的太突然，太快了
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly real fast.

828
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,858
你看到了吗，林克？
Are you watching this, Link?

829
01:23:50,956 --> 01:23:53,783
是长官  他们全都朝你们驶来了  有八辆警车
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you. Eight units headed your way.

830
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:56,970
有什么建议吗？
Any suggestions?

831
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,566
-向右转   -快右转
-Turn right.   -Right, now.

832
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:12,085
直走，你们会撞倒一道拦网，然后抵达连接101公路的隧道
Straight here. You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.

833
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:14,938
-明白   -长官，你确定要这么做吗？我意思是，那条高速，它非常危险
-Got it.   -Sir, are you sure about this?  The freeway, I mean. It's dangerous.

834
01:24:14,963 --> 01:24:18,671
我已经在船上呆了14个年头了，长官，可我从未见过……   -林克！我是怎么跟你说的？
-ln 14 years of operating, I've never seen   -Link, what did I tell you?

835
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:20,418
遵命，长官  我相信你
Yes, sir.  I do, sir.

836
01:24:20,418 --> 01:24:21,643
Winslow高架桥……
Winslow overpass.

837
01:24:21,653 --> 01:24:23,526
-我会做好准备  -好样的
-I'll be ready for you.   -Good man.

838
01:24:24,193 --> 01:24:26,291
你总说要避开高速公路
You always told me to stay off the freeway.

839
01:24:26,316 --> 01:24:29,318
-是的，没错   -你说过那就是自杀
-Yes, that's true.   -You said it was suicide.

840
01:24:29,343 --> 01:24:31,148
那就让我们希望……
Then let us hope...

841
01:24:31,254 --> 01:24:32,690
我说错了吧
...that I was wrong.

842
01:24:44,293 --> 01:24:45,885
-接线员  -林克，我是奈奥比
-Operator.   -Link, it's Niobe.

843
01:24:46,001 --> 01:24:47,574
我们奉命来接你们回去
We've been sent to bring you in.

844
01:24:47,599 --> 01:24:50,636
-我要和墨菲斯讲话   -相信我，他正需要你
-I need to talk to Morpheus.   -Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

845
01:24:50,661 --> 01:24:52,876
-他在那儿？  -跟着警车走就行
-Where is he?   -Just follow the sirens.

846
01:25:00,503 --> 01:25:02,336
我重复一遍，他们正靠近……
Repeat, they're approaching the

847
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:09,506
-找到他们了  -流亡者是首要目标
-We have them now.  -The exile is the primary target.

848
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:14,606
有人开枪
Shots fired.

849
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,636
快点！
Move!

850
01:28:08,923 --> 01:28:12,023
我们惹上麻烦了 是的，没错
We are getting aggravated.  Yes, we are.

851
01:28:58,266 --> 01:28:59,700
崔妮蒂
Trinity.

852
01:29:00,673 --> 01:29:01,803
快带他离开这儿
Get him out of here.

853
01:29:05,409 --> 01:29:06,609
快来啊！
Come on!

854
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:25,969
撞死他
Crush him.

855
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:57,520
墨菲斯
Morpheus.

856
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:59,140
他没事的  不要停下
He's okay.  Keep moving.

857
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:01,666
咱们走
Let's go.

858
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:09,860
我要载入程序强行启动摩托车
I need a download to hotwire a motorcycle.

859
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:12,428
没问题，摩托车速成
No problem.  One crash course on motorcycle

860
01:30:12,453 --> 01:30:13,706
等等
Wait.

861
01:30:15,313 --> 01:30:16,803
取消操作
Cancel that.

862
01:30:17,013 --> 01:30:18,626
你可真及时
You are handy.

863
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:20,530
上车
Jump on.

864
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:49,765
她不重要
She means nothing.

865
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:52,853
去找流亡者  已经找到了
Find the exile.  We have them.

866
01:32:52,878 --> 01:32:54,853
请回答

867
01:33:01,769 --> 01:33:03,242
蹲下
Get down.

868
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:15,966
找到你了
Gotcha.

869
01:35:16,863 --> 01:35:17,873
她可真行
She's good.

870
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:24,486
你现在已经没必要存在
You are no longer necessary.

871
01:35:31,117 --> 01:35:34,563
我们只是在做我们应该做的
We do only what we're meant to do.

872
01:35:36,643 --> 01:35:40,233
那你应该做的事只有一件：被删除
Then you are meant for one more thing: deletion.

873
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,660
把他干掉
Go kick his ass.

874
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,906
尼奥，如果你听得见的话，我们需要帮助
Neo, if you're out there, I could use some help.

875
01:36:36,693 --> 01:36:38,013
那是什么？
What is that?

876
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:10,810
耶！耶！
Yes! Yes!

877
01:37:17,483 --> 01:37:22,520
长官，我们已从伊卡洛斯号得到确认，带头的两艘战舰已进入反击位置
Sir, we have confirmation from the lcarus.  First two ships are in position for counterattack.

878
01:37:22,830 --> 01:37:23,820
很好
Good.

879
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:25,860
有什么动向？
Any change?

880
01:37:26,403 --> 01:37:29,129
看起来它们钻到了铁矿  掘进速度减慢了一点点
Looks like they hit some iron ore here. Slowed them down a little.

881
01:37:29,154 --> 01:37:32,100
-慢了多少？  -大约一个小时
-How much?   -An hour, maybe.

882
01:37:32,401 --> 01:37:34,818
那就是说它们还需要九个小时多一点
That would give them a little over nine hours.

883
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:36,978
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

884
01:38:09,833 --> 01:38:11,886
有一栋大厦
There is a building.

885
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:17,615
在那栋大厦里，有一个楼层，没有电梯可以通往那儿
Inside this building, there is a level where no elevator can go...

886
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:20,040
也没有楼梯可以到达
...and no stair can reach.

887
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:26,681
那一层里面全都是门  那些门通往很多地方
This level is filled with doors. These doors lead to many places.

888
01:38:26,768 --> 01:38:28,734
不为人知的地方
Hidden places.

889
01:38:29,825 --> 01:38:32,776
但有一扇门很特殊
But one door is special.

890
01:38:33,399 --> 01:38:35,691
它能通往代码之源
One door leads to the source.

891
01:38:43,936 --> 01:38:48,243
那栋大厦被级别很高的安全系统保护着
This building is protected by a very secure system.

892
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:53,153
-任何一个警报器都能触发炸弹   -炸弹？他是说炸弹？
-Every alarm triggers the bomb.   -Bomb? Did he say bomb?

893
01:38:53,353 --> 01:38:55,936
但像所有系统一样，它也有个弱点
But like all systems, it has a weakness.

894
01:38:56,146 --> 01:38:59,136
这个系统也遵循着建筑物共同的规则
The system is based on the rules of a building.

895
01:38:59,330 --> 01:39:02,866
-一个系统需要建立在另一个之上   -电力系统
-One system built on another.   -Electricity.

896
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:07,780
-一个系统失效，其他的就必然失效   -没有了电就无法触发警报
-If one fails, so must the other.   -No electricity, no alarms.

897
01:39:07,809 --> 01:39:11,170
必须要切断整个街区的电力，才能切断像这样一栋建筑的电力
You'd have to take out a whole city block to kill the power of the building like that.

898
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:14,836
-不是一个，是27个   -27个街区？
-Not one, 27.   -Twentyseven blocks?

899
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:18,099
有一个供电站
There is a power station.

900
01:39:18,269 --> 01:39:20,499
必须将其摧毁
It must be destroyed.

901
01:39:20,653 --> 01:39:25,058
-肯定还有什么后备系统吧？  -是的，有一个应急供电系统
-There must be some kind of failsafe.   -Yes, there is an emergency system.

902
01:39:26,673 --> 01:39:30,231
必须进入街区网络的核心部分
The core network of the grid must be accessed.

903
01:39:30,730 --> 01:39:33,675
必须切断这个应急系统
The emergency system must be deactivated.

904
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:35,130
那还需要我们做什么呢？
What do you need us for?

905
01:39:35,436 --> 01:39:37,454
尼奥能比我们更轻易的办到这些
Neo could take them out easier than we could.

906
01:39:37,479 --> 01:39:39,359
-时间来不及   -为什么？
-There's no time.   -Why?

907
01:39:39,416 --> 01:39:42,506
一旦那扇门失去保护，连接将会被切断
Once the door is unprotected, the connection will be severed.

908
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,205
不过必须首先建立另一个连接
But another connection must first be made.

909
01:39:45,936 --> 01:39:49,766
-需要多长时间？  -整整314秒（圆周率，暗示救世主使命的循环）
-How long will that take?   -Exactly 314 seconds.

910
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,660
五分钟多一点
Just over five minutes.

911
01:39:51,685 --> 01:39:53,905
那就是整个窗口期的长度
That is the length and breadth of the window.

912
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:59,542
只有救世主才能开启那道门，也只有在那段窗口期门才能被打开
Only the One can open the door, and only during that window can the door be opened.

913
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:02,380
你是怎么知道这些的？
How do you know all this?

914
01:40:02,586 --> 01:40:07,366
因为我必须知道  这就是我存在的目的
I know because I must know. It is my purpose.

915
01:40:08,003 --> 01:40:12,881
这就是我来这儿的原因  也是同样的原因让我们所有人来到这里
It's the reason I'm here, the same reason we're all here.

916
01:40:24,147 --> 01:40:26,500
尼奥，我知道你有心事
Neo, I know something's wrong.

917
01:40:27,650 --> 01:40:29,543
但你不必告诉我
You don't have to tell me.

918
01:40:29,877 --> 01:40:32,750
我只想告诉你，我会一直你身边
I just want you to know that I'm here.

919
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:38,680
大家必须团结一致
All must be done as one.

920
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:45,030
戴着也无妨
Can't hurt.

921
01:40:48,623 --> 01:40:50,650
一次失败……
If one fails...

922
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:52,930
全盘皆输
...all fail.

923
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:57,330
两栋大厦的警卫都会在午夜换岗
At midnight, there is a shift change in the security of both buildings.

924
01:40:58,550 --> 01:41:01,970
我们也将在午夜出击
At midnight, we will strike.

925
01:41:03,996 --> 01:41:07,536
-要睡回家睡   -为啥？在这儿睡还能拿工钱
-You count sheep at home.   -Why? I get paid to count them here.

926
01:41:17,970 --> 01:41:20,196
好了，他们进去了
Okay, they're inside.

927
01:41:20,423 --> 01:41:22,798
-还有多长时间？  -12分钟
-How much time?   -Twelve minutes.

928
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:26,670
哦，糟了
Oh, shit.

929
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:35,674
我们每个人都将自己的一生投入了这场战争  今晚  我相信就是它的终结之时
All of our lives, we have fought this war. Tonight, I believe we can end it.

930
01:41:37,036 --> 01:41:38,956
选在今晚绝非偶然
Tonight is not an accident.

931
01:41:40,490 --> 01:41:43,903
没有什么是出于偶然
There are no accidents.

932
01:41:43,928 --> 01:41:48,920
我们来到这里不是偶然  我也从不相信偶然
We have not come here by chance.  I do not believe in chance.

933
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:54,660
当我看到三个目标、三位舰长、三艘战舰……
When I see three objectives, three captains, three ships...

934
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:58,360
我看到的不是偶然  我看到了天意
...I do not see coincidence.  I see providence.

935
01:41:58,710 --> 01:42:01,040
我看到了意义
I see purpose.

936
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:10,070
我相信命中注定我们要来到这里  这就是我们的宿命
I believe it is our fate to be here.  It is our destiny.

937
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:15,250
我相信今晚将关系到我们所有人……
I believe this night holds for each and every one of us...

938
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:18,760
生命的意义所在
...the very meaning of our lives.

939
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:22,550
我想请你做一件事，但我不知该怎么说
I want to ask you to do something, but I don't know how.

940
01:42:23,562 --> 01:42:25,482
我答应你，只要情况允许，我一定会做到
I promise you, if I can, I will.

941
01:42:26,932 --> 01:42:29,732
如果我想让你不要参与这次行动……
What if I asked you to stay out of this...

942
01:42:31,169 --> 01:42:33,189
不论什么情况发生……
...no matter what...

943
01:42:33,463 --> 01:42:35,643
都不要进入矩阵呢？
...to stay out of the Matrix?

944
01:42:36,770 --> 01:42:38,412
为什么？
Why?

945
01:42:46,705 --> 01:42:47,886
求你了
Please.

946
01:42:49,956 --> 01:42:51,219
好吧
All right.

947
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:56,280
怎么了？奈奥比
What is it, Niobe?

948
01:42:57,335 --> 01:43:01,615
我是忍不住在想，墨菲斯……忍不住去想：如果你错了呢？
I can't help it, Morpheus.  I can't help thinking, what if you're wrong?

949
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:05,136
如果所有这些，还有那个预言，一切的一切都是扯谎呢？
What if all this, the prophecy, everything, is bullshit?

950
01:43:05,161 --> 01:43:08,078
那明天将是我们所有人的忌日
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

951
01:43:09,623 --> 01:43:12,102
但那又与其他的日子有何不同呢？
But how would that be different from any other day?

952
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:28,090
这是一场战争，而我们是战士
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

953
01:43:28,115 --> 01:43:31,266
死亡，可能在任何时间……
Death can come for us at any time...

954
01:43:31,596 --> 01:43:33,366
任何地点，降临到我们头上
...and any place.

955
01:43:33,883 --> 01:43:35,598
有情况！
Incoming.  Incoming!

956
01:43:35,623 --> 01:43:36,818
接近警报
PROXIMITY ALERT

957
01:43:37,322 --> 01:43:39,025
有情况！
Incoming!

958
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:44,763
整船人丧命于一个小小的意外，冥冥之中照应了本舰的名字——警醒号
圣经 马可福音 13:32 “警醒准备”：
至于那日子和时间，没有人知道，连天上的天使和子也不知道，只有父知道

959
01:43:45,210 --> 01:43:47,390
但反过来想想
Now consider the alternative.

960
01:43:47,850 --> 01:43:52,410
如果是我对的呢？ 如果预言成真了呢？
What if I am right?  What if the prophecy is true?

961
01:43:52,682 --> 01:43:56,942
如果明天就能结束这场战争呢？
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

962
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:00,895
这难道不值得为之战斗吗？
Isn't that worth fighting for?

963
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:04,730
难道不值得为之牺牲吗？
Isn't that worth dying for?

964
01:44:05,630 --> 01:44:08,163
-还有多久？  -三分钟
-Time?  -Three minutes.

965
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:09,603
就快好了
Almost there.

966
01:44:29,566 --> 01:44:30,936
钥匙做好了
It is done.

967
01:44:31,173 --> 01:44:32,426
找找其他人
Find the others.

968
01:44:33,486 --> 01:44:35,878
找到奈奥比了  他们在供电站外面
I got Niobe there.  They're out of the station.

969
01:44:35,903 --> 01:44:38,490
-索伦怎么样？  -在那
-What about Soren?  -There.

970
01:44:38,916 --> 01:44:40,672
他们还在里面，不过……
They're still inside, but....

971
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:42,643
他们没有行动
They're not moving.

972
01:45:06,573 --> 01:45:08,300
好了，我们走
That's it, let's go.

973
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:12,486
立即呼叫尼奥
Call Neo now.

974
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:19,336
-我跟丢他们了  他们在网关里  -街区怎么样了？
-I lost them. They're inside the portal.   -What about the grid?

975
01:45:20,406 --> 01:45:21,910
更改供电系统……紧急供电系统启动
PERROUTING POWER……EMERGEMCY SYSTEMS ACTIVATED

976
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:27,287
一切照常运转  紧急供电系统已经接管供电
Everything is still operational. The emergency system is rerouting power.

977
01:45:32,533 --> 01:45:34,584
上帝啊
Jesus.

978
01:45:35,126 --> 01:45:39,004
只要他们打开那扇门，一切都完了
Soon as they open that door, it's all over.

979
01:45:39,309 --> 01:45:40,319
去他妈的
The hell it is.

980
01:45:41,906 --> 01:45:43,272
你要干嘛？崔妮蒂
What are you? Trinity!

981
01:45:44,317 --> 01:45:47,745
我不能站在这儿袖手旁观  我不能眼看着他们死掉
I will not wait and do nothing.  I will not watch them die.

982
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:50,045
崔尼蒂，我们只有不到五分钟的时间
Trinity,  We're talking less than five minutes.

983
01:45:50,070 --> 01:45:52,590
五分钟足够我夷平那栋天杀的大厦了
In five minutes, I'll tear that whole goddamn building down.

984
01:45:52,833 --> 01:45:55,639
-还有多远？  -到了，这就到了
-How much further?   -Here, just here.

985
01:45:57,610 --> 01:46:00,856
对不起，此路不通
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

986
01:46:02,435 --> 01:46:05,113
这一定是我搞过的最险恶的入侵
It's gotta be the ugliest hack I have ever done.

987
01:46:08,429 --> 01:46:11,456
我只能送你到那了  你可得生出翅膀才行
That's as close as I can get you. You better grow wings.

988
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:31,240
-接线员   -我进来了
-Operator.   -I'm in.

989
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:33,364
继续前进，第65层
Keep moving. Sixtyfifth floor.

990
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:38,192
再次见到我，你似乎有点意外啊，安德森先生
You look surprised to see me again, Mr. Anderson.

991
01:46:38,647 --> 01:46:43,878
好吧，我们还是有那么一点区别的：我可一直在期待你呢
Well, that's the difference between us.  I have been expecting you.

992
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:47,135
-你想要什么，史密斯？  -你还没想出来吗？
-What do you want, Smith?   -Oh, you haven't figured that out?

993
01:46:47,266 --> 01:46:52,367
还是那么四肢发达，头脑简单
Still using all the muscles except the one that matters.

994
01:46:52,830 --> 01:46:55,354
我想要的正是你想要的
I want exactly what you want.

995
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,438
我想要一切
I want everything.

996
01:46:58,210 --> 01:47:00,721
是否也包括这支枪里的子弹？
Would that include a bullet from this gun?

997
01:47:00,906 --> 01:47:02,666
好啊，开枪吧
Go ahead, shoot.

998
01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:07,966
我最大的长处就是，用之不竭
The best thing about being me, there's so many me's.

999
01:47:19,497 --> 01:47:22,396
老天呐，这儿到底发生了什么？
Christ!  What the hell happened in here?

1000
01:47:24,089 --> 01:47:25,569
站在那别动，女士！
Hold it right there, little lady.

1001
01:47:35,456 --> 01:47:37,170
如果你打不赢我们......
If you can't beat us....

1002
01:47:37,195 --> 01:47:38,710
那就变成我们
Join us.

1003
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,460
墨菲斯
Morpheus!

1004
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:55,006
（准许进入）

1005
01:47:56,060 --> 01:47:59,066
还是找不到他们  但不管他们在做什么，现在只剩下两分钟了
Still no sight of them. Don't know what they do, but yhey only got two minutes left.

1006
01:48:04,462 --> 01:48:06,262
（错误：紧急供电系统失效）

1007
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:10,200
（供电故障）

1008
01:48:13,042 --> 01:48:14,032
一分钟
One minute.

1009
01:48:23,353 --> 01:48:24,343
快点
Come on.

1010
01:48:25,323 --> 01:48:26,860
快点
Come on.

1011
01:48:27,757 --> 01:48:29,416
求你了
Please.

1012
01:48:39,710 --> 01:48:41,176
杀了他们
Kill them.

1013
01:48:49,210 --> 01:48:50,230
他们进去了
They're in.

1014
01:48:50,255 --> 01:48:52,215
真难以置信
I don't believe it.

1015
01:49:07,716 --> 01:49:09,776
这是命中注定
It was meant to be.

1016
01:49:10,170 --> 01:49:15,441
墨菲斯，那道门通往回家的路
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

1017
01:49:24,232 --> 01:49:28,473
你知道是哪扇门  快去吧，尼奥
You will know which door.   Hurry, Neo.

1018
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:37,330
崔妮蒂，你前面有大麻烦了
Trinity, I got some serious activity headed your way.

1019
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:30,980
你好，尼奥
Hello, Neo.

1020
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:35,240
-你是谁？  -我是建筑师
-Who are you?   -I am the Architect.

1021
01:50:35,477 --> 01:50:39,031
是我创造了矩阵 我一直在等你
I created the Matrix.  I've been waiting for you.

1022
01:50:39,505 --> 01:50:43,547
你有很多问题要问  尽管the process（一个程序）已经改变了你的意识……
You have many questions.  Though the process has altered your consciousness...

1023
01:50:43,572 --> 01:50:45,720
但你依然不可避免地属于人类
...you remain irrevocably human.

1024
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:49,460
因此，我的有些回答你能理解，有些则不能
Ergo, some of my answers you will understand and some you will not.

1025
01:50:49,870 --> 01:50:53,930
通常，虽然你的第一个问题是最具相关性的——
Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent...

1026
01:50:54,110 --> 01:50:57,810
你或许能、或许不能意识到——它也是最无关紧要的
...you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant.

1027
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:00,310
我为什么会来到这儿？
Why am I here?

1028
01:51:00,366 --> 01:51:04,525
你生命是矩阵编程中固有的……
Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation...

1029
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:07,102
一个未能平衡的等式的余数之和
...inherent to the programming of the Matrix.

1030
01:51:07,127 --> 01:51:11,325
你是一种变异的结果  尽管我对此付出了最大的努力
You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts...

1031
01:51:11,350 --> 01:51:14,257
还是未能消除余数，否则……
...I've been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise...

1032
01:51:14,282 --> 01:51:18,255
就能实现数学精确性的和谐了
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

1033
01:51:19,275 --> 01:51:21,489
虽然它依然是一个应当竭力避免的负担
While it remains a burden assiduously avoided...

1034
01:51:21,514 --> 01:51:26,085
但是却并非不可预测，因此也不会超出可控制的范围
...it is not unexpected and thus not beyond a measure of control...

1035
01:51:26,270 --> 01:51:30,052
是它导致你，不可避免地，来到了……
...which has led you, inexorably...

1036
01:51:31,212 --> 01:51:32,377
这里
...here.

1037
01:51:32,765 --> 01:51:36,457
-你并没有回答我的问题   -完全正确
-You haven't answered my question.   -Quite right.

1038
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:40,751
有意思  你的反应比其他的更快
Interesting.  That was quicker than the others.

1039
01:51:40,776 --> 01:51:43,611
其他人？有几个？ 什么其他的？
Others?  How many?  What others?

1040
01:51:43,636 --> 01:51:46,095
矩阵比你所知的更古老
The Matrix is older than you know.

1041
01:51:46,344 --> 01:51:50,501
我喜欢统计从一个完备的变异体出现，到下一个完备的变异出现的次数
I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next.

1042
01:51:50,526 --> 01:51:52,845
在这种统计方式下，现在是第六个版本
In which case, this is the sixth version.

1043
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:55,568
在我之前还有五种？ 他在撒谎  放屁吧你
Five before me?  He's lying.  Bullshit.

1044
01:51:55,593 --> 01:51:59,009
可能的解释只有两种：
There are only two possible explanations. There were five before me.

1045
01:51:59,034 --> 01:52:00,438
要么是没人告诉我
Either no one told me...

1046
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,732
-要么根本没人知道   -完全正确
-...or no one knows.   -Precisely.

1047
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:09,399
当你无疑是在集中注意力思考的时侯，那种变异也是一系列的……
As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic...

1048
01:52:09,399 --> 01:52:12,510
使得 即使是最简单的等式中 也发生了波动
...creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.

1049
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:16,220
你休想控制我  我要把你撕得粉碎
You can 't control me!  I'm gonna smash you to bits!

1050
01:52:16,245 --> 01:52:18,335
你给我滚开 你去死吧
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1051
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:21,333
你无法逼我做任何事  你个老白毛
You can 't make me do anything.  You old, white prick!

1052
01:52:23,733 --> 01:52:25,081
选择
Choice.

1053
01:52:25,483 --> 01:52:27,108
问题就在于选择
The problem is choice.

1054
01:52:49,507 --> 01:52:53,335
我设计的第一代矩阵自然是非常完美的  是一件艺术品……
The first Matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect.  It is a work of art.

1055
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:55,099
完美无瑕  堪称崇高
Flawless, sublime.

1056
01:52:55,290 --> 01:52:58,820
只有它不朽的失败，可以与它伟大的成功相提并论
A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure.

1057
01:52:59,530 --> 01:53:05,393
它不可避免的厄运，现在看来显然是——每个人类固有的缺陷所造成的结果
The inevitability of its doom is apparent now......as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human.

1058
01:53:05,563 --> 01:53:08,523
因此，我基于人类的历史重新设计了矩阵……
Thus, I redesigned it based on your history...

1059
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:12,937
为了精确地反映你们本性中的种种怪诞
...to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

1060
01:53:13,489 --> 01:53:16,962
然而，我再一次遭受了失败的困扰
However, I was again frustrated by failure.

1061
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:23,635
从那以后我开始明白，答案之所以一直回避我，是因为这需要一个不那么刻意的头脑……
I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind.

1062
01:53:23,660 --> 01:53:29,087
或者说，一个不那么刻意去追求完美的头脑
Or perhaps, a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection.

1063
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:34,615
于是，答案就被另外一个，依靠直觉运行的程序，偶然发现了
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program...

1064
01:53:35,026 --> 01:53:39,534
那个程序创造的初衷，是为了调查人类心理的某些方面
...initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche.

1065
01:53:39,934 --> 01:53:45,612
如果说我是矩阵之父，她就无疑是矩阵之母
If I am the father of the Matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.

1066
01:53:46,153 --> 01:53:48,278
-是先知   -请安静
-The Oracle.   -Please.

1067
01:53:49,383 --> 01:53:53,655
正如刚才所说，她偶然发现了一种解决方案，可以使接近99%的受试者……
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby  nearly 99 percent of tested subjects...

1068
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:56,240
接受矩阵程序，前提是给予他们选择
...accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice...

1069
01:53:56,265 --> 01:54:00,192
即使他们只能在近乎无意识的程度上，意识到选择的存在
...even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level.

1070
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:04,024
虽然这个方案有效，但它显然存在根本性的缺陷……
While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed...

1071
01:54:04,024 --> 01:54:08,290
从而产生了另一种相矛盾的系统性变异……
...thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly...

1072
01:54:08,489 --> 01:54:11,226
如果不加以控制，它可能会威胁到系统本身
...that, if left unchecked, might threaten the system itself.

1073
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:15,815
因此，那些拒绝了矩阵程序的人，尽管是少数，但若不加以控制
Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked...

1074
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:19,654
将导致灾难发生的概率不断增加
...would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.

1075
01:54:20,106 --> 01:54:21,788
这指的是锡安
This is about Zion.

1076
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:25,990
你来到这里，是因为锡安将会被摧毁
You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed.

1077
01:54:26,143 --> 01:54:30,619
那里的所有居民都将消灭  它的整个存在都会被抹去
Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.

1078
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,045
一派胡言
Bullshit.

1079
01:54:32,070 --> 01:54:35,190
否认是所有的人类反应中最好预测的
Denial is the most predictable of all human responses.

1080
01:54:35,366 --> 01:54:41,988
不过请放心，这将是我们第六次将其彻底摧毁
But rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it...

1081
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:46,038
而且我们已经在这方面，做得越来越高效了
...and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.

1082
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:00,265
救世主的作用……
The function of the One...

1083
01:55:00,290 --> 01:55:04,990
就是在此时返回代码之源，将你携带的代码的副本……
...is now to return to the source, allowing a dissemination of the code you carry...

1084
01:55:05,015 --> 01:55:07,405
重新插入the prime program
...reinserting the prime program.

1085
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:11,420
这之后，你将被要求从矩阵中选出23个人……
After which you will be required to select from the Matrix 23 individuals...

1086
01:55:11,445 --> 01:55:14,650
包含16位女性和7位男性，他们将重建锡安
...sixteen female, seven male, to rebuild Zion.

1087
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:19,715
不遵守这个流程，将会导致灾难性的系统崩溃
Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash...

1088
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:22,148
杀死每一个接入矩阵的人类
...killing everyone connected to the Matrix...

1089
01:55:22,173 --> 01:55:24,733
同时伴随着锡安的消亡
...which, coupled with the extermination of Zion...

1090
01:55:24,758 --> 01:55:29,073
最终会导致整个人类物种的彻底灭绝
...will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.

1091
01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:33,549
你不会让这种事发生的  你不能  你们需要依靠人类来生存
You won't let it happen. You can't. You need human beings to survive.

1092
01:55:34,393 --> 01:55:37,959
我们已经准备好去接受不同级别的生存
There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.

1093
01:55:38,325 --> 01:55:40,925
然而，相关的问题是，你，有没有准备好……
However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready...

1094
01:55:40,950 --> 01:55:44,970
为这个世界上所有人的死亡承担责任呢？
...to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.

1095
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:53,620
观察你的反应是件很有意思的事情
It is interesting reading your reactions.

1096
01:55:54,810 --> 01:55:58,630
在刻意设计之下，你的5位前辈都是基于了相似的预言——
Your five predecessors were, by design, based on a similar predication...

1097
01:55:58,655 --> 01:56:03,425
（译者能力实在有限，但用人话翻译出来大概就是：
the one 是从人类中随机选出的，只要先知考察觉得他充满了对他人的责任感——
这种对人类的“大爱”却恰恰是建筑师要利用的，用来在此时威胁他交出代码）

也就是一种视情况而定的支持/肯定——意在建立起一种，对你们物种的其他人的深刻的依恋感……
...a contingent affirmation， that was meant to create a profound attachment...

1098
01:56:03,450 --> 01:56:07,050
促使你们完成救世主的任务
...to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the One.

1099
01:56:07,075 --> 01:56:13,031
虽然其他救世主的经历几乎相同，你的经历却远比他们特殊：
While the others experience this in a general way, your experience is far more specific...

1100
01:56:13,056 --> 01:56:15,635
要面对爱情
...visavis love.

1101
01:56:16,832 --> 01:56:18,105
崔妮蒂！
Trinity!

1102
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:25,130
恰在此时，她进入矩阵来挽救你的生命，代价是牺牲自己的生命
Apropos, she entered the Matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.

1103
01:56:25,743 --> 01:56:26,707
不！
No.

1104
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:31,555
这最终将我们带到了揭开真相的时刻——此时，人类根本缺陷的最终表现、以及变异的揭示，从始至终都没有改变
Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, where in the fundamental flaw...

1105
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:34,640
这最终将我们带到了揭开真相的时刻——此时，人类根本缺陷的最终表现，以及变异情况的揭示
...is ultimately expressed and the anomaly revealed...

1106
01:56:34,665 --> 01:56:38,651
这最终将我们带到了揭开真相的时刻——此时，人类根本缺陷的最终表现、以及变异的揭示，从始至终都没有改变
...as both beginning and end.

1107
01:56:38,990 --> 01:56:44,272
这里有两扇门  你右边那扇通向代码之源，并将拯救锡安
There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source and the salvation of Zion.

1108
01:56:44,630 --> 01:56:50,699
你左边那扇可以通向矩阵，回到她的身边，并导致人类物种的毁灭
The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her and the end of your species.

1109
01:56:51,036 --> 01:56:55,333
正如你所说，问题在于如何选择
As you adequately put, the problem is choice.

1110
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:58,847
但是我们已经知道你的选择了，不是吗？
But we already know what you are going to do, don't we?

1111
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:03,495
我已经看到了连锁反应，一种化学前体的出现……
Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal...

1112
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:08,955
标志着一种专门用来压倒逻辑和理性的情感的引发
...the onset of an emotion designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.

1113
01:57:09,112 --> 01:57:13,661
那种情感已经令你对显而易见的真相视而不见……
An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth:

1114
01:57:13,756 --> 01:57:19,712
真相就是：她终将死去，而你没有任何办法阻止
She is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it.

1115
01:57:25,270 --> 01:57:29,476
希望  它是人类最典型的幻想……
Hope.  It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously...

1116
01:57:29,501 --> 01:57:33,083
同时是你们最大的力量，以及最大的弱点 的源头所在
...the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.

1117
01:57:33,669 --> 01:57:37,582
如果我是你，我希望我们再也不要见面了
If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.

1118
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,130
我们不会再见面了
We won't.

1119
01:57:46,830 --> 01:57:48,345
出大事了，长官
We got a serious situation, sir.

1120
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:50,399
哦，糟了
Oh, no.

1121
01:58:50,286 --> 01:58:53,660
-那是什么？   -反正我从没见过速度这么快的东西
-What was that?   -Whatever it is, it's moving faster than anything I've seen.

1122
01:59:44,370 --> 01:59:46,070
老天呐，他接住她了
Holy shit, he caught her.

1123
01:59:59,997 --> 02:00:01,976
尼奥，我必须这么做
Neo, I had to.

1124
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:03,796
我知道了
I know.

1125
02:00:09,033 --> 02:00:11,160
子弹还在你身体里
The bullet is still inside.

1126
02:00:22,290 --> 02:00:23,970
崔妮蒂
Trinity...

1127
02:00:25,350 --> 02:00:26,956
你可一定要挺住了
...don't you quit on me now.

1128
02:00:36,199 --> 02:00:38,547
对不起
I'm sorry.

1129
02:00:45,429 --> 02:00:47,442
崔妮蒂？
Trinity.

1130
02:00:57,699 --> 02:00:59,453
崔妮蒂？
Trinity...

1131
02:00:59,763 --> 02:01:01,489
我知道你能听到的
...I know you can hear me.

1132
02:01:02,399 --> 02:01:04,848
我不放你走
I'm not letting go.

1133
02:01:04,990 --> 02:01:06,554
绝不！
I can't.

1134
02:01:07,939 --> 02:01:09,930
我爱你爱的太深
I love you too damn much.

1135
02:01:38,983 --> 02:01:39,963
太感人了
I can't take this.

1136
02:01:43,856 --> 02:01:46,236
我想我们这下扯平了
I guess this makes us even.

1137
02:01:59,557 --> 02:02:01,190
我不能明白
I don't understand it.

1138
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:04,386
我们已经按照指定的方式做完了所有事情
Everything was done as it was supposed to be done.

1139
02:02:04,943 --> 02:02:08,210
一旦救世主到达代码之源，战争就应该结束才对
Once the One reaches the source, the war should be over.

1140
02:02:08,235 --> 02:02:10,756
-24小时之内，它确实会结束   -什么？
-ln 24 hours, it will be.   -What?

1141
02:02:11,136 --> 02:02:15,370
如果我们不采取措施，24小时内锡安就会被毁灭
If we don't do something in 24 hours, Zion will be destroyed.

1142
02:02:15,954 --> 02:02:17,536
-什么？  -你怎么知道的？
-What?   -How do you know that?

1143
02:02:17,890 --> 02:02:20,083
-有人告诉了我   -是谁？
-I was told it would happen.   -By whom?

1144
02:02:21,033 --> 02:02:24,095
谁说的不重要  我相信他不会撒谎
It doesn't matter.  I believed him.

1145
02:02:24,120 --> 02:02:27,728
-这不可能！预言说的是……   -预言只是个谎言，墨菲斯
-That's impossible. The prophecy tells us...    -lt was a lie, Morpheus.

1146
02:02:29,667 --> 02:02:31,980
救世主预言就是谎言
The prophecy was a lie.

1147
02:02:33,455 --> 02:02:35,853
“救世主”从来不能终结任何事情
The One was never meant to end anything.

1148
02:02:36,635 --> 02:02:39,165
“救世主”完全属于另一种控制系统
It was all another system of control.

1149
02:02:39,766 --> 02:02:41,988
我不相信！
I don't believe that.

1150
02:02:43,173 --> 02:02:45,267
那可是你亲口说的
But you said it yourself.

1151
02:02:45,670 --> 02:02:48,467
既然战争没有结束，预言怎么可能是真的？
How can the prophecy be true if the war isn't over?

1152
02:02:55,853 --> 02:02:58,186
对不起
I'm sorry.

1153
02:02:58,555 --> 02:03:01,375
我知道这很难接受……
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

1154
02:03:02,009 --> 02:03:04,414
但我发誓这就是真相
...I swear to you it's the truth.

1155
02:03:08,439 --> 02:03:11,152
-那我们该怎么办？  -我不知道
-What are we gonna do?   -I don't know.

1156
02:03:13,357 --> 02:03:14,431
哦不！
Oh, no!

1157
02:03:23,946 --> 02:03:27,220
-它们在干嘛？  -避免进入电磁脉冲（EMP）的爆炸范围
-What are they doing?   -They're just out of EMP range.

1158
02:03:27,786 --> 02:03:28,966
那是个炸弹
It's a bomb.

1159
02:03:30,153 --> 02:03:32,353
我们必须离开这儿，快！
We have to get out of here. Now.

1160
02:04:09,063 --> 02:04:10,749
我梦见过这一幕……
I have dreamed a dream...

1161
02:04:13,976 --> 02:04:16,989
但现在，那个梦竟成为了现实
...but now that dream has gone from me.

1162
02:04:28,359 --> 02:04:29,592
它们来了
Here they come.

1163
02:04:30,853 --> 02:04:32,400
我们走，墨菲斯
Let's go, Morpheus.

1164
02:04:34,013 --> 02:04:36,673
-我们逃不掉的   -总要试试吧
-We won't make it.   -We have to try.

1165
02:04:44,895 --> 02:04:47,855
-快来啊！  -事情有些变化
-Come on!   -Something's different.

1166
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:49,900
什么？
What?

1167
02:04:50,626 --> 02:04:52,077
我能感觉到它们
I can feel them.

1168
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:16,400
尼奥！
Neo!

1169
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:25,646
-出了什么事？  -我也不知道
-What happened?   -I don't know.

1170
02:05:31,666 --> 02:05:33,473
是雷神之锤号（the Hammer，榔头，只是Mjolnir号的简称）
It's the Hammer.

1171
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:47,793
他处于某种昏迷中
He's in some kind of coma...

1172
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:50,060
但是他脉搏很平稳
...but his vitals are stable.

1173
02:05:51,652 --> 02:05:53,432
你怎么样了？
What about you?

1174
02:05:53,726 --> 02:05:55,319
我很好
I'm fine.

1175
02:05:56,019 --> 02:05:58,080
你应该好好休息一下
You could use some rest.

1176
02:05:58,496 --> 02:06:00,462
不了，我要陪着他
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

1177
02:06:07,223 --> 02:06:10,165
洛克是对的……
Lock was right.  He guessed that the machines...

1178
02:06:10,190 --> 02:06:13,205
他猜到机器大军会切断通往锡安的主要管道
...would cut off the mainlines in and out of Zion.

1179
02:06:13,230 --> 02:06:15,937
他想到借此反攻会让机器大吃一惊
He thought a counterattack might surprise them.

1180
02:06:16,230 --> 02:06:19,795
计划听起来很不错，我本想着一定能行的……
It sounded good. I figured we had a shot...

1181
02:06:20,077 --> 02:06:22,341
结果有人搞砸了一切
...until someone screwed it up.

1182
02:06:22,366 --> 02:06:25,377
我们还没就位，就有人触发了EMP武器
An EMP was triggered before we got in position.

1183
02:06:25,402 --> 02:06:29,630
-五艘战舰立刻就垮了  -机器攻进船里的时候……
-Five ships were instantly downed.   -When the machines broke through...

1184
02:06:29,655 --> 02:06:32,776
那根本算不上一场战斗，那就是一场屠杀
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

1185
02:06:32,801 --> 02:06:35,454
那是个意外吗？出了某种故障？
Was it an accident?  Some sort of malfunction?

1186
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:38,477
-没人知道  -有个人知道
-No one knows.   -Someone does.

1187
02:06:38,572 --> 02:06:39,957
谁？
Who?

1188
02:06:40,493 --> 02:06:44,265
机器消灭完我们的人之后，就开始继续挖掘了
Once the machines were done with us, they started digging again.

1189
02:06:44,290 --> 02:06:47,890
-我们马上出去寻找幸存者  -找到了一个？
-We made a quick pass to look for survivors.   -You found one?

1190
02:06:49,703 --> 02:06:51,323
只有一个
Only one.

1191
02:16:44,539 --> 02:16:48,857
万物有始必有终
Everything that has a beginning......has an end.

1192
02:16:51,869 --> 02:16:54,729
我看到末日降临
I see the end coming.

1193
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:58,966
我看到黑暗正在蔓延  我看到死亡
I see the darkness spreading.  I see death.

1194
02:17:01,029 --> 02:17:03,889
欢迎归来，安德森先生
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

1195
02:17:04,220 --> 02:17:06,210
我们都很想你
We missed you.

1196
02:17:06,350 --> 02:17:08,180
今晚就要结束
It ends tonight.

1197
02:17:15,390 --> 02:17:18,520
只有你才能阻止他
You are all that stands in his way.

1198
02:17:20,090 --> 02:17:24,668
如果你今晚不能阻止他，那么我担心明天可能永远不会到来
If you cannot stop him tonight, then I fear that tomorrow may never come.
