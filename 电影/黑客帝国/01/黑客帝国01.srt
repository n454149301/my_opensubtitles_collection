你相信吗？

我怎么想不重要
lt doesn't matter what l believe.

303号房间
（暗合了基督教中圣父、圣子、圣灵“三位一体”<i>Trinity</i> 的概念，对应了电影开场崔尼蒂出现在此地
代码“HTTP 303”亦用于将Web 应用程序重定向到新 URI，对应抵抗者通过房间里的电话线从矩阵中转移回现实世界）

17
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,797
-别动！警察！-双手抱头！
-Freeze! Police!  -Hands on your head !

嘿，我只是照例行事

少跟我讲“我说的就是法律”的废话，趁早闭嘴吧
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"
crap, you can cram it up your ass.

24
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,194
命令是为了保护你们的安全
The orders were for your protection.

25
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:42,059

我们需要尽快展开搜索

已经在查了
It has already begun.

49
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,506
醒醒，尼奥

50
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,155
什么？
What?

51
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:30,452
矩阵奴役着你

52
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,333
什么鬼？
What the hell?

53
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,857
“跟着白兔走”
"Follow the white rabbit."

54
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:51,359
有人敲门，尼奥

55
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:57,111

好吧
Yeah. Yeah.

58
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:10,241
101号房间
（尼奥的公寓是101，暗示他成为<i>the One</i> 的命运
可能源自于奥威尔《1984》中的设定：101号房是囚犯遭受最恐怖的心理折磨的地方 对应尼奥在这里夜夜难眠）

59
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,243
你晚来了两个小时
You're two hours late.

60
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,578
我知道 都是她的错
I know. It's her fault.

61

63
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,013
等着
Hold on.

64
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:32,731
（此书名为<i>Simulacras and Simulation</i> 《假象与模拟》，是一本1981 年出版的哲学论文，尼奥翻开的这一章是<i>On Nihilism</i>，即“论虚无主义”）

65
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:41,022
哈利路亚
Hallelujah.

66
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,663
你真是我的救主，伙计  我本人的耶稣基督
You're my savior, man. My own personal Jesus Christ.

67
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:46,309
要是你被逮到使用它...
You get caught using that...

68
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:48,998
我知道  这次交易没发生过  你并不存在
I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.

69
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,032
-很好  -出什么事了吗，伙计?
-Right.  -Something wrong , man?

70
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:54,094
你看起来比平时还苍白
You look a little whiter than usual.

71
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,331
我的电脑，它……
My computer, it...

72
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,493
你有没有过这种感觉
Ever have that feeling,

73
00:09:03,237 --> 00:09:05,706
不知道自己是醒着还是在梦中
where you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?

74
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,087
一直都是这样  这叫嗑嗨了
All the time.  It's called mescaline.

75
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,118
只有这样才能放飞自我
It's the only way to fly.

76
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:15,273
听起来你需要休息（双关：拔下插头），伙计
It just sounds like you need to unplug, man.

77
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:17,396
好好放松一下？
Get some R and R?

78
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:21,313
你怎么想的，Dujour？ 要不要带他一起去？

00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,811

Definitely.

80
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,571

（Trinity 即“三位一体”）
崔尼蒂

90
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:25,467
那个崔尼蒂？
The Trinity?

91
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,560
入侵国税局数据库的那个崔尼蒂？
That cracked the IRS D-base?

92
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,219
那是很久之前的事了
That was a long time ago.

93
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:31,179
-上帝啊  -怎么？
-Jesus.  -What?

94
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,512
我本以为……
I just thought...

95
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:36,433
你是个男的
...you were a guy.

96
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,145
多数男人都这么想的
Most guys do.

97
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:40,937
是你在我的电脑上发消息
That was you on my computer.

98
00:10:42,162 --> 00:10:43,429
你怎么做到的？
How did you do that?

99
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,622
现在，我能告诉你的只有……
Right now, all I can tell you...

100
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,628
你有危险了
...is that you're in danger.

101
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,725
-我带你来是想警告你   -警告什么？
-I brought you here to warn you.  -Of what?

102
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,821
他们在监视你，尼奥
They're watching you , Neo.

103
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:57,187
-谁？  -请听我说

104
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,265
我知道你为什么来这儿，尼奥

105
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:04,812
我知道你做了些什么
I know what you've been doing.

106
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,193
我知道为什么你难以入睡
I know why you hardly sleep...

107
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:10,770
为什么你一个人生活，以及为什么每个夜晚……
...why you live alone and why, night after night...

108
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,813
你都要坐在电脑前
...you sit at your computer.

109
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:15,928
你是在找他
You're looking for him.

110
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,951
我知道，是因为我也曾寻找他
I know, because I was once looking for the same thing.

111
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:21,831
当他找到我的时候……
And when he found me...

112
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,820
他告诉我，我其实不是在找他……
...he told me I wasn't really looking for him...

113
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:28,994
我是在寻找答案
...I was looking for an answer.

114
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:32,735
是那个问题驱使着我们，尼奥
It's the question that drives us, Neo.

115
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:35,648
是那个问题让你来到这里
It's the question that brought you here.

116
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:39,437
你知道问题是什么……
You know the question...

117
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:40,890
和我一样
...just as I did.

118
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,345
矩阵是什么？
What is the Matrix?

119
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,541
答案近在眼前，尼奥
The answer is out there, Neo.

120
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:49,621
它也在寻找你
It's looking for you.

121
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:52,261
它会找到你……
And it will find you...

122
00:11:52,454 --> 00:11:53,901
如果你愿意
...if you want it to.

123
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,013
该死
Shit.

124
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,389
Shit, shit.

125
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:05,513
（Metacortex公司，meta+cortex，即 超越大脑皮层）

126
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,258
你不喜欢服从权威，安德森先生
You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson.

127
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,782
你认为自己很特殊，可以不受规矩的约束
You believe that you are special, that the rules do not apply to you.

128
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,302
很显然，你错了
Obviously, you are mistaken.

129
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:29,480
这是一个领跑全球的软件公司……
This is one of the top software companies in the world...

130
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,186
是因为每个员工都明白自己是整体的一部分
...because employees understand they are part of a whole.

131
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:37,381
因此，一个员工出了问题， 就意味着公司出了问题
Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem.

132
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:43,058
你该做出选择了，安德森先生
The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson.

133
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:47,998
要么准时出现在办公桌前，从今天开始
Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth...

134
00:12:48,874 --> 00:12:51,271
要么就另谋高就
...or you choose to find yourself another job.

135
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:53,706
我讲清楚了吗？
Do I make myself clear?

136
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,886
是的，Mr. Rhineheart 非常清楚了
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart. Perfectly clear.

137
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:05,846
托马斯·安德森？
Thomas Anderson?

138
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,057
是的，我就是
Yeah , that's me.

139
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:11,062
Okay.

140
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,339
好的
Great.

141

145
00:13:45,345 --> 00:13:47,249
我一直在找你，尼奥
I've been looking for you, Neo.

146
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:50,972
我想给你看些东西，我不知道你有没有准备好
I don 't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you.

147
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,729
但很不幸，我们已经没有时间了
But unfortunately, you and I have run out of time.

148
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:58,129
他们来找你了，尼奥 我不知道他们会对你做什么
They're coming for you, Neo. And l don't know what they're going to do.

149
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,656
谁来找我？
Who's coming for me?

150
00:13:59,996 --> 00:14:01,903
站起来，自己看吧
Stand up and see for yourself.

151
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,730

What? Right now?

152
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,271
是的 现在
Yes. Now.

153
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,221
慢慢站起来
Do it slowly.

154
00:14:09,806 --> 00:14:10,915
电梯旁
The elevator.

155
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,198
-哦，糟糕！  -是的
-Oh , shit!  -Yes.

156
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,404
他们到底想要什么？
What the hell do they want from me?

157
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:27,205
我不知道 但是要是你也不想知道，就赶快走
I don 't know. But if you don 't want to find out, I suggest you get out of there.

158
00:14:27,672 --> 00:14:28,072
怎么做？
How?

159
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,318
我可以指导你，但是你必须严格按照我说的去做
I can guide you, but you must do exactly as l say.

160
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,374
-好吧   -你对面的隔间是空着的
-Okay.  -The cubicle across from you is empty.

161
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:39,561
-但如果他们……   -快去  现在！
-But what if they……  -Go. Now.

162
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,763
在这儿等一会儿
Stay here for just a moment.

163
00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:58,954
等我告诉你去做的时候，走到这排的尽头……
When l tell you, go to the end of the row...

164
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,167
……到角落那间办公室里
...to the office at the end of the hall.

165
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,329
身体尽量压低
Stay as low as you can.

166
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:06,989
去吧 现在
Go. Now.

167
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:24,732
很好 现在，外面有一个吊篮
Good. Now, outside there is a scaffold.

168
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:30,196
-你怎么知道的？  -我们没时间了，尼奥
-How do you know this?  -We don't have time, Neo.

169
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:33,035
你的左边有一个窗户 过去
To your left there 's a window. Go to it.

170
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,310
打开窗户
Open it.

171
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,519
你要用吊篮上到楼顶
You can use the scaffold to get to the roof.

172
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:42,591
不行  不行！ 你疯了吗！
No way! No way! This is crazy!

173
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:45,169
只有两种方法离开这栋建筑
There are two ways out of this building.

174
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:48,774
要么用吊篮  要么被他们押出去
One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.

175
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,003
你要走哪条路，自己选吧
You take a chance either way. l leave it to you.

176
00:15:56,148 --> 00:15:57,701
这太疯狂了！
This is insane!

177
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,731
为什么会发生在我身上？
Why is this happening to me?

178
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,591
我都做了些什么？
What'd I do?

179
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:05,784
我只是个小人物  我什么都没做
I'm nobody. I didn't do anything.

180
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,925
我会死的
I'm gonna die.

181
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:18,769
该死！
Shit!

182
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,166
糟糕！
Oh, shit!

183
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:46,819
我不可能做到的
I can't do this.

184
00:16:59,874 --> 00:17:00,714
该死
Shit.

185
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:55,283
正如你所见，我们关注你有段时间了，安德森先生
As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

186
00:17:56,137 --> 00:17:58,872
看起来你过着……
It seems that you've been living...

187
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,669
两种生活
...two lives.

188
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:05,125
第一种生活中，你叫托马斯·A·安德森……
In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson...

189
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,921
是知名软件公司的程序员
...program writer for a respectable software company.

190
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:13,146
你有社会保障码 你依法缴税
You have a social security number. You pay your taxes.

191
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:14,442
而且你还……
And you...

192
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,807
会帮房东太太倒垃圾
...help your landlady carry out her garbage.

193
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:25,296
另一种是电脑里的生活……
The other life is lived in computers...

194
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:28,899
在那里你是个化名为“尼奥”的黑客
...where you go by the hacker alias "Neo"...

195
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:33,820
跟电脑相关的法律，你差不多违反了个遍
...and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for.

196
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:36,991
这两种生活中的一种……
One of these lives...

197
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:38,861
是有未来的
...has a future.

198
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:41,194
另一种则没有
And one of them does not.

199
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,712
我尽可能说的直白些，安德森先生
I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

200
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:50,953
请你来这儿……
You're here...

201
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:53,345
是因为我们需要你的帮助
...because we need your help.

202
00:18:57,623 --> 00:19:00,740
我们知道……
We know that you've been contacted by a certain...

203
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,141
有一个人联系过你
...individual.

204
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,354
一个自称是”墨菲斯“的男子
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

205
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,098
你怎么看待这个人无关紧要
Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant.

206
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,413
但他被各个权威机构认为是……
He is considered by many authorities...

207
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:18,300
当今最危险的人
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

208
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,559
我的同事们……
My colleagues...

209
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,204
相信我是在跟你白费功夫
...believe that I am wasting my time with you.

210
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:29,502
但我却相信你想要做正确的事
But I believe you wish to do the right thing.

211
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:33,063
我们愿意把旧账一笔勾销……
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

212
00:19:33,803 --> 00:19:35,800
让你重新开始
...give you a fresh start.

213
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:39,376
我们要的只是你的合作……
All we're asking in return is your cooperation...

214
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:42,973
将这个臭名昭著的恐怖分子绳之以法
...in bringing a known terrorist to justice.

215
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,432
好吧
Yeah.

216
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,979
这交易听上去真不错
That sounds like a really good deal.

217
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,183
但我有更好的
But I think I got a better one.

218
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:53,833
要不……
How about...

219
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,659
我给你竖个中指……
...I give you the finger...

220
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:01,117
你让我打个电话
...and you give me my phone call.

221
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:05,042
安德森先生……
Umm, Mr. Anderson...

222
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:10,802
你太让我失望了
...you disappoint me.

223
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:13,310
别想用盖世太保那套鬼话吓唬我
You can't scare me with this gestapo crap.

224
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,850
我知道自己的权利
I know my rights.

225
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:16,828
我现在要打个电话
I want my phone call.

226
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:19,259
告诉我，安德森先生……
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

227
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:21,964
打电话还有什么用……
...what good is a phone call...

228
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:25,516
如果让你话都说不出来？
...if you're unable to speak?

229
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:01,859
你会帮我们的，安德森先生
You're going to help us, Mr. Anderson...

230
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:04,373
不管你愿不愿意
...whether you want to or not.

231
00:22:02,693 --> 00:22:05,793
电话线被监听了，所以我长话短说
This line is tapped, so l must be brief.

232
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:10,287
他们先找到你了，但是他们不知道你有多重要
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.

233
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,511
如果他们知道我所知道的事……
If they knew what l know...

234
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:14,642
你恐怕已经死了
...you would probably be dead.

235
00:22:15,853 --> 00:22:19,753
你在说什么？我怎么了？
What are you talking about? What is happening to me?

236
00:22:19,778 --> 00:22:25,369
你是救世主，尼奥  你看，你可能这些年都在找我……
You are the One, Neo. You see, you may have spent the last few years...

237
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:27,988
但是我花了一辈子……
...looking for me, but l've spent my entire life...

238
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,556
来找你
...looking for you.

239
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,167
你现在还想来见我吗？
Now, do you still want to meet?

240
00:22:34,232 --> 00:22:37,169
-是的  -那就去Adams街的桥下
-Yes.  -Then go to the Adams Street bridge.

241
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,263
进来
Get in.

242
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,021
这是干什么？
What the hell is this?

243
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:04,608
这是必要的手段，尼奥  为了我们的安全
It's necessary, Neo. For our protection.

244
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,802
-谁会伤害你们？   -你
-From what?  -From you.

245
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:09,988
-脱掉上衣  -什么？
-Take off your shirt.  -What?

246
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:11,542
停车
Stop the car.

247
00:23:15,663 --> 00:23:16,896
听好了，白痴
Listen to me, coppertop.

248
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,623
我们没空听你问东问西
（双关：20 Questions  整个三部曲尼奥刚好问了20个问题）
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

249
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,858
现在，只有一条规矩
Right now, there's only one rule:

250
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,537
听我们的……
Our way...

251
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,124
要不就去高速公路（滚下车）
...or the highway.

252
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:32,703
那好吧
Fine.

253
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,041
求你了，尼奥，你得相信我
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

254
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,252
-为什么？  -因为你已经来过这里，尼奥
-Why?  -Because you have been down there, Neo.

255
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,212
你走过这条路
You know that road.

256
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,070
你非常清楚路的尽头是什么
You know exactly where it ends.

257
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:49,303
而我知道你不想去那儿
And I know that's not where you want to be.

258
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,877
艾波克，开灯
Apoc, lights.

259
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,625
躺下 上衣掀起来
Lie back. Lift up your shirt.

260
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:14,171
-这是什么？  -你被窃听了
-What's that?  -I think you're bugged.

261
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:22,940
努力放松
Try and relax.

262
00:24:29,457 --> 00:24:30,497
快点
Come on.

263
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:32,638
快来吧
Come on.

264
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:35,604
它在动了
It's on the move.

265
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,293
快点，混蛋
Come on, you shit.

266
00:24:40,114 --> 00:24:42,481
-你会让它跑掉的   -我不会的
-You're gonna lose it.  -No, I'm not.

267
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,732
看到了！
Clear!

268
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:54,451
上帝啊！ 那东西是真的！？
Jesus Christ! That thing's real!?

269
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,466
这儿就是了
This is it.

270
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,210
我来给你一条建议
Let me give you one piece of advice.

271
00:25:36,363 --> 00:25:37,790
要诚实
Be honest.

272
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,782
他所知道的东西远超你的想象
He knows more than you can imagine.

273
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,800
终于
At last.

274
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,365
欢迎你，尼奥
Welcome, Neo.

275
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,532
你无疑已经猜到……
As you no doubt have guessed...

276
00:25:57,879 --> 00:25:59,152
我就是墨菲斯
...I am Morpheus.

277
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:01,568
很荣幸见到你
It's an honor to meet you.

278
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,101
不
No...

279
00:26:03,821 --> 00:26:05,189
这是我的荣幸
...the honor is mine.

280
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,863
请这边坐
Please, come. Sit down.

281
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:25,175
我猜
I imagine...

282
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:28,842
你现在感觉有点像爱丽丝
...that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice...

283
00:26:30,316 --> 00:26:32,718
跌进了兔子洞？
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

284
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:34,685
可以这么说
You could say that.

285
00:26:35,472 --> 00:26:37,505
我能从你眼中看出来
I can see it in your eyes.

286
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:41,699
为了从梦中醒来……
You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees...

287
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:44,073
你会相信亲眼所见的一切
...because he's expecting to wake up.

288
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,404
讽刺的是，这离事实不远了
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.

289
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,319
你相信命运吗，尼奥？
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

290
00:26:52,137 --> 00:26:52,772
不信
No.

291
00:26:53,318 --> 00:26:54,355
为什么不？
Why not?

292
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,428
因为我不喜欢对自己的生活失去控制
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.

293
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,551
我完全明白你的意思
I know exactly what you mean.

294
00:27:06,035 --> 00:27:08,017
我来告诉你你为什么会来到这里吧
Let me tell you why you're here.

295
00:27:09,362 --> 00:27:11,015
因为你知道了一些东西
You are here because you know something.

296
00:27:11,486 --> 00:27:13,148
这些东西，你自己也无法解释
What you know, you can't explain.

297
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,134
但你就是能感觉到
But you feel it.

298
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:17,926
你这一生都感觉得到：
You felt it your entire life:

299
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:22,545
这个世界有些异样  你不知道是什么，但就是觉得不对
That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there.

300
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,105
如同扎在心头的一根刺……
Like a splinter in your mind...

301
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,229
快要把你逼疯
...driving you mad.

302
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,821
正是这种感受把你带到了我面前
It is this feeling that has brought you to me.

303
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,513
你明白我在说什么吗？
Do you know what I'm talking about?

304
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:38,487
矩阵？
The Matrix?

305
00:27:40,864 --> 00:27:42,532
你 想要 知道
Do you want to know...

306
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:45,059
它究竟是什么吗？
...what it is?

307
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:49,373
矩阵无处不在
The Matrix is everywhere.

308
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:51,246
它就在我们身边
It is all around us.

309
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:53,773
甚至此时此刻，它就在这间屋子里
Even now, in this very room.

310
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,708
当你看向窗外……
You can see it when you look out your window...

311
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,957
或者打开电视，都能看到它
...or when you turn on your television.

312
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:02,360
无论是你上班的时候……
You can feel it when you go to work...

313
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,132
去教堂的时候……
...when you go to church...

314
00:28:05,812 --> 00:28:07,785
还是缴税的时候，都可以感觉到它的存在
...when you pay your taxes.

315
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,127
它就是这个充斥了你的视野的世界……
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes...

316
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:13,729
阻挡你看见真相
...to blind you from the truth.

317
00:28:15,982 --> 00:28:17,098
什么真相？
What truth?

318
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:23,746
你是个奴隶，尼奥
That you are a slave, Neo.

319
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:27,154
和所有人一样，你生在囹圄之中
Like everyone else, you were born into bondage...

320
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:31,557
生在一座囚禁了你所有感官的监狱中里
...born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.

321
00:28:32,026 --> 00:28:33,157
一座……
A prison...

322
00:28:33,569 --> 00:28:34,836
囚禁你的意识的监狱
...for your mind.

323
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,000
不幸的是，没有人可以……
Unfortunately, no one can be...

324
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,640
被告知矩阵究竟是什么
...told what the Matrix is.

325
00:28:50,338 --> 00:28:52,138
除非让你亲眼得见
You have to see it for yourself.

326
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:03,890
这是你最后的机会
This is your last chance.

327
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:06,497
一旦做出选择，再无回头之路
After this, there is no turning back.

328
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:08,416
吃下蓝药丸……
You take the blue pill...

329
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:11,934
故事到此为止，你会在床上醒来并继续相信……
...the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe...

330
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,699
你愿意相信的一切
...whatever you want to believe.

331
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:15,356
吃下红药丸……
You take the red pill...

332
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,473
你将继续漫游奇境
...you stay in Wonderland...

333
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,759
我会将想你展示这兔子洞有多深
...and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

334
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,797
切记……
Remember...

335
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,677
我向你展示的只有真相  没有别的
...all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.

336
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,284
跟我来
Follow me.

337
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,585
艾波克，我们接上线路了吗？
Apoc, are we on-line?

338
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,161
快了
Almost.

339
00:30:00,616 --> 00:30:02,659
时间总是对我们不够用
Time is always against us.

340
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,469
请坐在这儿
Please, take a seat there.

341
00:30:22,793 --> 00:30:24,586
-你也经历过这一切？  -对啊
-You did all this?  -Mm-hm.

342
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,805
你服下的药丸是追踪程序的一部分
The pill you took is part of a trace program.

343
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:36,015
作用是干扰你的输入输出载波信号，好让我们给你定位
It's designed to disrupt your input/outout carrier signals, so we can pinpoint your location.

344
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,587
什么意思？
What does that mean?

345
00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:40,575
意思是系好安全带，小妞（多萝西）
It means buckle your seat belt, Dorothy...

346
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,935
跟你的老家（堪萨斯州）
...because Kansas...

347
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:43,194
说拜拜吧
...is going bye-bye.

348
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:22,428
你看到了吗？
Did you...?

349
00:31:33,574 --> 00:31:37,230
你可曾做过这样的梦，尼奥  一个让你无比相信那就是真实的梦？
Have you ever had a dream , Neo, that you were so sure was real?

350
00:31:39,068 --> 00:31:41,695
如果你无法从那个梦中醒来，该怎么办？
What if you were unable to wake from that dream?

351
00:31:41,971 --> 00:31:44,717
你又该如何区分梦境……
How would you know the difference between the dream world...

352
00:31:45,132 --> 00:31:46,484
和现实世界？
...and the real world?

353
00:31:48,238 --> 00:31:49,331
这不可能
This can't be.

354
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:50,451
什么不可能？
Be what?

355
00:31:51,238 --> 00:31:52,625
不可能是真的？
Be real?

356
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,183
-开始复制信号  -艾波克？
-It's going into replication.  -Apoc?

357
00:31:58,427 --> 00:31:59,428
还是没找到
Still nothing.

358
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:00,892
冷
It's cold.

359
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,552
好冷！
It's cold!

360
00:32:06,588 --> 00:32:08,256
坦克，尽快发信号过来
Tank, we're going to need a signal soon.

361
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:12,371
-检测到房颤  -艾波克，定位信息
-I got a fibrillation.  -Apoc, location.

362
00:32:12,396 --> 00:32:13,870
马上定位到目标了
Targeting almost there.

363
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:18,685
他的心跳要停止了
He's going into arrest.

364
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,523
-锁定 我找到他了  -坦克，就现在！
-Lock. I got him!  -Now, Tank, now!

365
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:19,894
欢迎……
Welcome...

366
00:35:20,227 --> 00:35:22,049
来到真实的世界
...to the real world.

367
00:35:23,605 --> 00:35:25,329
我们做到了，崔尼蒂
We've done it, Trinity.

368
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:27,082
我们找到了他
We found him.

369
00:35:27,509 --> 00:35:30,073
-希望你是对的   -我不用“希望”
-I hope you're right.  -I don't have to hope.

370
00:35:30,821 --> 00:35:32,280
我“相信”
I know it.

371
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:38,668
我是死了吗？
Am I dead?

372
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:41,140
早着呢
Far from it.

373
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,655
他还需要很长时间的恢复
He still needs a lot of work.

374
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,436
你们在做什么？
What are you doing?

375
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:01,981
你的肌肉萎缩了  我们在帮你重生肌肉
Your muscles atrophied. We're rebuilding them.

376
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:04,137
我的眼睛怎么这么疼？
Why do my eyes hurt?

377
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,618
因为你从未睁开过双眼
You've never used them before.

378
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,478
休息吧，尼奥
Rest, Neo.

379
00:36:11,573 --> 00:36:13,171
你就快知道答案了
The answers are coming.

380
00:37:27,906 --> 00:37:29,490
墨菲斯，我怎么了？
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

381
00:37:30,362 --> 00:37:31,345
这是哪里？
What is this place?

382
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:34,242
你更应该问现在是“什么时候”了
More important than "what" is "when."

383
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:35,503
“什么时候”？
"When"?

384
00:37:35,811 --> 00:37:37,770
你以为现在是1999年……
You believe it's the year 1999...

385
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,377
其实是更接近2199年
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

386
00:37:41,496 --> 00:37:44,001
我没法告诉你具体是哪一年……
I can't tell you exactly what year it is...

387
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:46,014
因为说实话我也不知道
...because we honestly don't know.

388
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:49,711
我无法用语言向你解释，尼奥
There's nothing I can say that will explain it for you.

389
00:37:49,736 --> 00:37:52,282
跟我来  亲眼来看看吧
Come with me. See for yourself.

390
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:54,595
这就是我的战舰
This is my ship.

391
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,859
（来自圣经《但以理书》，尼布甲尼撒二世为其妻建造了巴比伦的空中花园）
尼布甲尼撒号  是一艘气垫船
The Nebuchadnezzar. It's a hovercraft.

392
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,447
这是主甲板
This is the main deck.

393
00:38:08,715 --> 00:38:09,966
这里是控制中枢
This is the core...

394
00:38:11,715 --> 00:38:15,575
我们在这里广播非法信号黑进矩阵
...where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix.

395
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:22,371
大多数船员你都认识了
Most of my crew you already know.

396
00:38:27,376 --> 00:38:28,671
这是艾波克
This is Apoc...

397
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,809
斯维奇
...Switch...

398
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,687
-还有塞弗
-...and Cypher.  -Hi.

399
00:38:33,905 --> 00:38:37,617
你没见过的是坦克和他哥哥多泽
The ones you don't know: Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

400
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,677
你身后的小家伙是耗子
The little one behind you is Mouse.

401
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:48,869
你想见识矩阵是什么吗，尼奥？
You wanted to know what the Matrix is, Neo?

402
00:38:49,585 --> 00:38:50,724
Trinity.

403
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:13,036
试着放轻松
Try to relax.

404
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,196
你会感觉有点怪异
This will feel a little weird.

405
00:39:32,095 --> 00:39:33,471
这里……
This...

406
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,206
就是主架构
...is the Construct.

407
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,750
这是我们的载入程序
It's our loading program.

408
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,461
我们可以载入任何东西，从衣服……
We can load anything, from clothing...

409
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,088
到装备……
...to equipment...

410
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,715
武器
...weapons...

411
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:46,138
仿真训练
...training simulations...

412
00:39:46,657 --> 00:39:49,136
我们需要的任何东西
...anything we need.

413
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,502
现在我们是在计算机程序里？
Right now we're inside a computer program?

414
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,519
真的如此难以接受吗？
Is it really so hard to believe?

415
00:39:57,126 --> 00:40:00,026
你穿的衣服变了  手臂上和脑后的接口也没了
Your clothes are different. The plugs in your arms and head are gone.

416
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,828
你的发型也变了
Your hair has changed.

417
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:06,780
你现在的外貌叫做"自我形象残留"
Your appearance now is what we call "residual self-image."

418
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:10,443
它是你数字自我的心理映射
It is the mental projection of your digital self.

419
00:40:16,032 --> 00:40:17,158
这不是真的？
This isn't real?

420
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:18,745
什么是“真实”？
What is "real"?

421
00:40:19,306 --> 00:40:21,479
如何去定义“真实”？
How do you define "real"?

422
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:23,944
如果你指的是可被感知到的事物……
If you're talking about what you can feel...

423
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:26,691
可以被闻到，被尝到，被看到的……
...what you can smell , taste and see...

424
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:30,569
那所谓的“真实”就无非是大脑里处理的电信号
...then "real" is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.

425
00:40:34,718 --> 00:40:37,039
这是你所熟悉的那个世界
This, is the world that you know.

426
00:40:38,529 --> 00:40:41,491
这个世界处在20世纪末的样子
The world as it was at the end of the 20th century.

427
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:48,246
现在它只存在于神经网络交互模拟系统中，成为了它的一部分
It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation...

428
00:40:48,485 --> 00:40:49,824
它被我们称为矩阵
...that we call the Matrix.

429
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:57,084
你一直生活在梦境中，尼奥
You've been living in a dream world , Neo.

430
00:40:58,145 --> 00:40:59,465
这才是世界……
This is the world...

431
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:01,268
现实的模样
...as it exists today.

432
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:17,225
欢迎来到……
Welcome to "the desert...

433
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,336
“真实的荒漠”
...of the real."

434
00:41:23,163 --> 00:41:25,741
我们只掌握了残缺不全的资料
We have only bits and pieces of information.

435
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:29,635
但我们确知的是，在21世纪初的某个时刻……
But what we know for certain is that at some point in the early 21st century,

436
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,216
人类普天同庆
...all of mankind was united in celebration.

437
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:38,763
我们惊叹于自己的伟大成就，也就是AI的诞生
We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.

438
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:39,842
A.I.

439
00:41:41,056 --> 00:41:42,531
你是指人工智能
You mean artificial intelligence.

440
00:41:42,556 --> 00:41:47,029
一种非凡的的意识催生了整个机器种族。
A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines.

441
00:41:47,891 --> 00:41:51,352
究竟是我们还是它们率先进攻已不得而知
We don't know who struck first, us or them.

442
00:41:51,837 --> 00:41:55,048
不过是我们熏黑了天空
But we know that it was us that scorched the sky.

443
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,102
当时，机器人十分依赖太阳能
At the time, they were dependent on solar power,

444
00:41:59,127 --> 00:42:02,755
而人类相信它们将无法存活……
...and it was believed that they would be unable to survive...

445
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,127
如果失去了像太阳这样充足的能量来源
...without an energy source as abundant as the sun.

446
00:42:06,314 --> 00:42:11,193
纵观人类历史，我们的生存一度是那么依赖机器
Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive.

447
00:42:12,806 --> 00:42:17,163
命运，看起来就是这么讽刺
Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.

448
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:24,851
人体产生的生物电，比一节120伏的电池还多
The human body generates more bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

449
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:29,005
还有产生的超过25000BTU的生物热
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

450
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,092
再结合核聚变的方式……
Combined with a form of fusion...

451
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:38,099
机器得到了所需的全部能源
...the machines had found all the energy they would ever need.

452
00:42:42,423 --> 00:42:46,177
这里有养殖场，尼奥，望不到边的牧场
There are fields, Neo, endless fields...

453
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:49,567
在那里人类不再是被生出来的
...where human beings are no longer born.

454
00:42:50,323 --> 00:42:52,047
而是被种植出来的
We are grown.

455
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,745
很长一段时间里，我并不相信这个
For the longest time, I wouldn't believe it.

456
00:43:01,054 --> 00:43:03,723
直到我亲眼看见发电厂……
And then I saw the fields with my own eyes...

457
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:06,877
看它们将死者液化
...watched them liquefy the dead...

458
00:43:06,902 --> 00:43:10,139
以便静脉注射饲喂给活人
...so they could be fed intravenously to the living.

459
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:15,120
我站在那儿，面对着这种纯粹的恐怖的精细
And standing there, facing the pure, horrifying precision...

460
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:18,185
我终于意识到事实就摆在眼前
...I came to realize the obviousness of the truth.

461
00:43:20,853 --> 00:43:22,546
矩阵本质上是什么？
What is the Matrix?

462
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:24,912
是控制
Control.

463
00:43:26,348 --> 00:43:29,566
矩阵就是电脑生成的梦境世界
The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world...

464
00:43:30,438 --> 00:43:33,525
用来控制我们
...built to keep us under control...

465
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:37,724
为了把人类……
...in order to change a human being...

466
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,617
变成电池
...into this.

467
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:41,984
不！
No.

468
00:43:43,818 --> 00:43:45,287
我不信
I don't believe it.

469
00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:46,969
这不可能
It's not possible.

470
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:52,359
我没说过这很容易接受，尼奥  但我说过，这就是真相
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.  I just said it would be the truth.

471
00:43:52,384 --> 00:43:53,413
快停下！
Stop!

472
00:43:54,273 --> 00:43:55,419
让我出去！
Let me out!

473
00:43:56,192 --> 00:43:58,332
放我出去！ 我要出去！
Let me out! I want out!

474
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,640
-放松，尼奥  放松  -把这玩意拔下来
-Easy, Neo. Easy.  -Get this thing out of me.

475
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,559
快给我拔下来！
Get this thing out of me!

476
00:44:06,263 --> 00:44:07,669
别碰我！
Don't touch me!

477
00:44:07,694 --> 00:44:09,505
别过来！
Stay away from me!

478
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,649
我不信
I don't believe it.

479
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,568
I don't believe it.

480
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,319
I don't believe it.

481
00:44:15,344 --> 00:44:17,712
-他要跪  -呼吸，尼奥
-He's gonna pop.  -Breathe, Neo.

482
00:44:18,082 --> 00:44:19,166
深呼吸
Just breathe.

483
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,260
我不能回头了，是不是？
I can't go back, can I?

484
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,452
不能
No.

485
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,635
就算你能回去……
But if you could...

486
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,892
你真的愿意这么做吗？
...would you really want to?

487
00:44:48,426 --> 00:44:50,039
我觉得应该向你道歉
I feel I owe you an apology.

488
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,780
我们有个规矩
We have a rule.

489
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:55,387
我们不能解救达到一定年龄限制的意识
We never free a mind once it's reached a certain age.

490
00:44:55,656 --> 00:44:56,993
这很危险
It's dangerous.

491
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,247
他们不能放下
The mind has trouble letting go.

492
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:01,609
我见过这样的事，我很抱歉
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

493
00:45:02,753 --> 00:45:04,770
我这么做也是因为……
I did what I did because...

494
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:06,929
迫不得已
...I had to.

495
00:45:15,418 --> 00:45:19,411
矩阵建立之初，里面诞生了一个人……
When the Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside...

496
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,653
他能够随心所欲地……
...who had the ability to change whatever he wanted...

497
00:45:24,191 --> 00:45:26,677
更改矩阵
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

498
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:32,287
就是他解放了我们的先民……
It was he who freed the first of us...

499
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,774
教导我们真相
...taught us the truth.

500
00:45:36,274 --> 00:45:39,461
只要矩阵还存在……
As long as the Matrix exists...

501
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,739
人类就永不得解脱
...the human race will never be free.

502
00:45:45,992 --> 00:45:47,429
他死后……
After he died...

503
00:45:48,299 --> 00:45:50,849
先知预言他将再临
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

504
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:54,710
他的到来将会彻底摧毁矩阵
...and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix...

505
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:56,551
结束这场战争
...end the war...

506
00:45:57,056 --> 00:45:58,411
为我们的子民带来自由
...bring freedom to our people.

507
00:45:59,607 --> 00:46:04,183
这就是为什么像我这样的人要终其一生在矩阵中搜索……
That is why there are those of us who spent our lives searching the Matrix...

508
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:05,856
寻找救世主
...looking for him.

509
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:10,558
我这么做是因为……
I did what I did because...

510
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:14,178
我相信我终于找到了
...I believe that search is over.

511
00:46:19,502 --> 00:46:20,798
休息一下吧
Get some rest.

512
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,217
你会用得着的
You're going to need it.

513
00:46:26,425 --> 00:46:27,467
为了什么？
For what?

514
00:46:30,532 --> 00:46:31,636
你的训练
Your training.

515
00:46:49,671 --> 00:46:51,304
早上好  昨晚睡着了吗？
Morning. Did you sleep?

516
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:53,500
今晚你就睡得着了
You will tonight.

517
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:55,331
我保证
I guarantee it.

518
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,858
我叫坦克  你的接线员
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

519
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,235
-你身上怎么没有……   -插孔吗？没有
-You don't, you don't have any-  Holes?  Nope.

520
00:47:02,681 --> 00:47:07,561
我和我哥多泽都是，百分百存粹的用古老的方生孕育的人类
Me and my brother, Dozer, are both 100% pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

521
00:47:07,586 --> 00:47:09,133
生而自由
Born free right here...

522
00:47:09,289 --> 00:47:10,749
生在真实的世界中
...in the real world.

523
00:47:10,967 --> 00:47:12,549
是真正的锡安的孩子
Genuine child of Zion.

524
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:16,017
-锡安？  -如果明天战争就会结束……
-Zion?  -If the war was over tomorrow...

525
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:17,713
锡安会欢庆的
...Zion's where the party would be.

526
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,359
它是座城市？
It's a city?

527
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:23,332
最后的人类城市  我们仅存的居住地
The last human city. The only place we have left.

528
00:47:24,284 --> 00:47:25,484
它在哪？
Where is it?

529
00:47:27,286 --> 00:47:30,859
深入地下，接近地核，那里比较暖和
Deep underground near the Earth's core, where it's still warm.

530
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:34,271
如果你命硬  没准还能亲眼看见呢
You live long enough, you might see it.

531
00:47:36,477 --> 00:47:41,592
天生的！ 我得告诉你，我真想见识下你的本事……
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited to see what you're capable of...

532
00:47:41,617 --> 00:47:43,277
如果墨菲斯是对的
...if Morpheus is right and all.

533
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,530
本来我不该说这个，但是……
We're not supposed to talk about this, but...

534
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,156
如果你真的是……
...if you are...

535
00:47:49,316 --> 00:47:51,208
那就太棒了
...it's a very exciting time.

536
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:55,039
我们有很多事情要做  我们得开始了
We got a lot to do.  We gotta get to it.

537
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:02,168
按理说，我们得先从这些操作程序学起
We're supposed to start with these operation programs first.

538
00:48:02,806 --> 00:48:06,749
这是最无聊的  让我们来点带劲的
That's major boring shit.  Let's do something more fun.

539
00:48:06,774 --> 00:48:08,135
不如就来……
How about...

540
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,354
格斗训练吧？
...combat training?

541
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,813
柔道？
"Jujitsu"?

542
00:48:19,968 --> 00:48:21,766
我要学柔道？
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

543
00:48:32,834 --> 00:48:34,044
我去！
Holy shit!

544
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:36,817
"嗨，小麦  我觉得他喜欢"（麦片广告语）
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

545
00:48:37,062 --> 00:48:38,355
还要再来一点吗？
How about some more?

546
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:39,834
要
Hell, yes.

547
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:43,294
当然要
Hell, yeah.

548
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,516
他怎么样了？
How is he?

549
00:48:56,541 --> 00:48:59,007
连着学了十个小时  简直是台机器
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.

550
00:49:09,924 --> 00:49:11,300
我会功夫了
I know kung fu.

551
00:49:13,315 --> 00:49:14,316
给我露一手
Show me.

552
00:49:15,749 --> 00:49:17,501
这是一个陪练程序
This is a sparring program...

553
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:20,499
与矩阵中编写的现实情况相似
...similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix.

554
00:49:20,795 --> 00:49:23,310
有着相同的基本规则  比如重力
It has the same basic rules.  Like gravity.

555
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:27,157
你必须清楚这些规则和计算机系统里的别无二致
What you must learn is that these rules are no different than those of a computer system.

556
00:49:27,472 --> 00:49:28,974
有些则可以变通
Some of them can be bent.

557
00:49:29,162 --> 00:49:31,591
另一些甚至可以打破
Others can be broken.

558
00:49:32,211 --> 00:49:33,296
明白了吗？
Understand?

559
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,823
那么来打我吧……
Then hit me...

560
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:36,974
如果你有本事做到
...if you can.

561
00:50:16,277 --> 00:50:17,320
很好！
Good !

562
00:50:17,605 --> 00:50:18,773
适应能力
Adaptation.

563
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,434
随机应变
Improvisation.

564
00:50:20,793 --> 00:50:22,200
但你的弱点
But your weakness...

565
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:23,687
并不于招式技巧
...is not your technique.

566
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,659
墨菲斯和尼奥打起来了
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

567
00:51:45,085 --> 00:51:46,325
我是怎么击败你的？
How did I beat you?

568
00:51:52,883 --> 00:51:53,968
你太快了
You're too fast.

569
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:56,088
你是相信……
Do you believe that...

570
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,841
我的更强更快
...my being stronger or faster...

571
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:02,622
在这里与我的肌肉有关系吗？
...has anything to do with my muscles in this place?

572
00:52:06,695 --> 00:52:08,488
你觉得现在呼吸的是空气吗？
You think that's air you're breathing now?

573
00:52:22,115 --> 00:52:23,324
再来！
Again!

574
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,181
上帝啊，他真快！
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

575
00:52:37,348 --> 00:52:39,821
瞧他的神经元活动，远超常人了
Take a look at his neuro-kinetics, they are way above normal.

576
00:52:44,984 --> 00:52:46,597
你还在等什么？
What are you waiting for?

577
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:48,525
你能做到的远比这个快
You're faster than this.

578
00:52:50,845 --> 00:52:53,288
不要光去想
Don't think you are.

579
00:52:53,313 --> 00:52:54,945
要相信你可以
Know you are.

580
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,873
来呀！别老试着打我，要真的做出来
Come on!  Stop trying to hit me, and hit me!

581
00:53:18,101 --> 00:53:19,668
难以置信
I don't believe it.

582
00:53:21,389 --> 00:53:23,248
我明白你是想做什么了
I know what you're trying to do.

583
00:53:25,245 --> 00:53:27,413
我想解放你的意识，尼奥
I'm trying to free your mind , Neo.

584
00:53:27,714 --> 00:53:29,800
但我只能将你领到门口
But I can only show you the door.

585
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:32,166
你只能自己走进去
You are the one that has to walk through it.

586
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:37,056
坦克，载入跳跃程序
Tank, load the jump program.

587
00:53:48,272 --> 00:53:51,078
你必须放下，尼奥  恐惧……
You have to let it all go, Neo.  Fear...

588
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,111
犹疑和不自信
...doubt and disbelief.

589
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,402
解放 你的 意识
Free  your  mind.

590
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:06,910
Whoa.

591
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:15,369
好吧 好吧
Okey-dokey.

592
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,672
解放我的意识
Free my mind.

593
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:20,800
要是他成功了呢？
What if he makes it?

594
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:23,659
-第一次没人能跳过去  -我知道
-No one's ever made their first jump.  -I know, I know.

595
00:54:24,606 --> 00:54:27,472
-但如果他跳过去了呢  -不会的
-But what if he does?  -He won't.

596
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:28,907
加油
Come on.

597
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,100
好吧
All right.

598
00:54:30,585 --> 00:54:32,913
没问题的  解放我的意识
No problem.  Free my mind.

599
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,190
解放我的意识  没问题的  好的
Free my mind.  No problem.  Right.

600
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:57,252
这是什么意思？
What does that mean?

601
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,463
没什么意思
It doesn't mean anything.

602
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:02,633
每个人第一次都会摔下去
Everybody falls the first time.

603
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,384
对吧，崔尼蒂？
Right, Trin?

604
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:28,085
-程序不是虚拟的吗  -你的大脑以为它成了真
-I thought it wasn't real.  -Your mind makes it real.

605
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,045
如果在矩阵中被杀……
If you're killed in the Matrix...

606
00:55:33,905 --> 00:55:35,015
就真的死了吗
...you die here?

607
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,389
没有了意识，身体没法存活
The body cannot live without the mind.

608
00:56:08,029 --> 00:56:11,009
我都不记得你哪次给我送过晚饭
I don't remember you ever bringing me dinner.

609
00:56:14,514 --> 00:56:16,954
他有些特别，不是吗？
There is something about him, isn't there?

610
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,543
你不会也信预言了吧？
Don't tell me you're a believer now?

611
00:56:20,657 --> 00:56:21,920
我只是好奇……
I keep wondering...

612
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:25,674
如果墨菲斯这么确定，为何不带他去见先知呢？
...if Morpheus is so sure, why not take him to see the Oracle?

613
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:29,293
等他准备好了墨菲斯自然会去的
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.

614
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,953
矩阵是一个系统，尼奥
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

615
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,241
这个系统是我们的敌人
That system is our enemy.

616
00:56:44,494 --> 00:56:47,087
但是在里面的时候，你看看四周，发现什么？
But when you're inside, you look around what do you see?

617
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,908
商人  教师  律师  木匠
Businessmen , teachers, lawyers, carpenters.

618
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,194
是我们亟待拯救的一个个意识
The very minds of the people we are trying to save.

619
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:57,679
但那之前，他们还是系统的一部分……
But until we do, these people are a part of that system...

620
00:56:57,704 --> 00:56:59,699
这意味着他们还是我们的敌人
...and that makes them our enemy.

621
00:56:59,724 --> 00:57:01,197
你得明白……
You have to understand...

622
00:57:01,222 --> 00:57:04,521
大多数人都没准备好被拔掉插头
...most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.

623
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,292
许多人惰性太强……
And many of them are so inert...

624
00:57:06,317 --> 00:57:09,026
如此无助地依赖着这个系统……
...so hopelessly dependent on the system...

625
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:11,570
他们甚至会奋力保护它
...that they will fight to protect it.

626
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:17,159
你是在听我说话呢，尼奥？  还是在看那个红衣女郎？
Were you listening to me, Neo? Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?

627
00:57:17,439 --> 00:57:18,881
-我在……  -再回头看看
-I was...  -Look again.

628
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:21,407
定格
Freeze it.

629
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:29,529
-这不是在矩阵中吗？  -不
-This isn't the Matrix?   -No.

630
00:57:31,415 --> 00:57:34,181
这也是个训练程序，为了让你明白一件事：
It's another training program designed to teach you one thing:

631
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:38,497
不属于我们的，就是敌人
If you are not one of us, you are one of them.

632
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,570
-他们是谁？  -监测程序
-What are they?  -Sentient programs.

633
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:46,939
他们能自由出入任何通过物理接口连上机器系统的软件
They can move in and out of any software still hardwired to their system.

634
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:50,314
也就是说任何没有拔掉插头的人
That means that anyone we haven't unplugged...

635
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:52,131
都是潜在的特工
...is potentially an agent.

636
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,863
在矩阵中……
Inside the Matrix...

637
00:57:55,462 --> 00:57:57,172
他们可以是任何人……
...they are everyone...

638
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,001
却又不是任何人
...and they are no one.

639
00:57:59,453 --> 00:58:02,528
碰到他们，我们可以靠躲藏或逃跑来逃过一劫
We have survived by hiding and running from them...

640
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,623
但他们也是守门人
...but they are the gatekeepers.

641
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,368
把守着每一个出入口，保管着所有的钥匙
They're guarding all the doors and holding all the keys.

642
00:58:07,393 --> 00:58:11,088
也就是说  总有一天有人得挑战他们
Which means that sooner or later, someone will have to fight them.

643
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:12,188
有人？
Someone?

644
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:13,877
我不想骗你，尼奥
I won't lie to you , Neo.

645
00:58:14,334 --> 00:58:19,173
每个不肯屈服的男人或女人，每一个挑战特工的人都已经死了
Every single man or woman who has stood their ground, everyone who has fought an agent has died.

646
00:58:19,424 --> 00:58:22,352
但他们做不到的，你会做到的
But where they have failed, you will succeed.

647
00:58:22,539 --> 00:58:23,243
为什么？
Why?

648
00:58:23,268 --> 00:58:25,769
我见过特工一拳打穿混凝土墙
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.

649
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:29,381
整支弹匣打空也伤不到他们
Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air.

650
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,532
可他们的力量与速度，仍然局限在矩阵的规则内
Yet their strength and speed are still based in a world built on rules.

651
00:58:34,564 --> 00:58:35,862
因此……
Because of that...

652
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:39,584
他们永远不可能和你一样的强大和迅速
...they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.

653
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:45,439
你是想告诉我什么？
What are you telling me?

654
00:58:46,228 --> 00:58:47,722
是告诉我我能躲子弹？
That I can dodge bullets?

655
00:58:49,629 --> 00:58:50,876
不，尼奥
No, Neo.

656
00:58:51,643 --> 00:58:54,096
我是说，当你准备好了……
I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready...

657
00:58:55,308 --> 00:58:56,642
你根本不必躲
...you won't have to.

658
00:59:01,558 --> 00:59:02,292
我们有麻烦了
We got trouble.

659
00:59:21,044 --> 00:59:23,703
-是锡安发来的警告吗？  -不，另一艘战舰发的
-Did Zion send the warning?  -No, another ship.

660
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:27,825
该死
Shit.

661
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:31,209
-乌贼扫荡得真快  -乌贼？
-Squiddy's sweeping in quick.  -Squiddy?

662
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,224
就是哨兵  专为一项任务设计的杀戮机器
A sentinel. A killing machine designed for one thing.

663
00:59:34,249 --> 00:59:36,235
搜寻并清除
Search and destroy.

664
00:59:37,309 --> 00:59:38,640
就把船停在那里
Set her down right over there.

665
01:00:00,279 --> 01:00:01,781
情况怎么样，坦克？
How are we doing, Tank?

666
01:00:10,018 --> 01:00:11,186
关闭电源
Power off-line.

667
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:13,444
EMP 充能……
EMP armed...

668
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:16,132
-就绪了  -EMP？
-...and ready.  -EMP?

669
01:00:16,157 --> 01:00:17,781
电磁脉冲武器
Electromagnetic pulse.

670
01:00:18,097 --> 01:00:20,917
能使爆炸范围内的所有电子系统瘫痪
Disables any electrical system in the blast radius.

671
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:23,370
是我们对抗机器的唯一武器
It's the only weapon we have against the machines.

672
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:32,508
-我们在哪？  -废弃的给排水系统里
-Where are we?  -Their old service and waste systems.

673
01:00:34,028 --> 01:00:34,856
下水管道
Sewers.

674
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,794
上面原来有方圆百里的城市
There used to be cities that spanned hundreds of miles.

675
01:00:38,225 --> 01:00:40,321
现在就只剩下水管路了
Now these sewers are all that's Ieft.

676
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:41,472
安静
Quiet.

677
01:01:22,305 --> 01:01:23,992
哇哦！尼奥
Whoa! Neo.

678
01:01:25,606 --> 01:01:27,775
你把我吓得个半死
You scared the bejesus out of me.

679
01:01:28,766 --> 01:01:30,626
-对不起  -算了
-Sorry.  -It's okay.

680
01:01:33,873 --> 01:01:34,714
这是……
Is that...?

681
01:01:34,739 --> 01:01:36,119
矩阵吗？
The Matrix?

682
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,633
是啊
Yeah.

683
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:42,570
-你查看的一直是它的代码吗?  -是呀，必须这样
-Do you always look at it encoded?  -Well, you have to.

684
01:01:42,903 --> 01:01:45,990
构建程序的时候才用到图像转换器
The image translators work for the construct program.

685
01:01:46,274 --> 01:01:49,599
但矩阵的信息量太大了，没法完全解码
But there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.

686
01:01:50,037 --> 01:01:53,148
你得习惯这么做  在我眼里这些不再是代码
You get used to it.  I don't even see the code.

687
01:01:53,173 --> 01:01:56,380
而是金棕头发、黑头发，红头发的人
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

688
01:01:57,711 --> 01:01:59,087
你想……
Do you...

689
01:01:59,405 --> 01:02:00,447
喝一杯吗？
...want a drink?

690
01:02:00,847 --> 01:02:01,807
可以
Sure.

691
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:06,794
要知道……
You know...

692
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,142
我明白你在想什么
...I know what you're thinking.

693
01:02:09,472 --> 01:02:11,558
因为此时此刻我也想着同样的事
Because right now I'm thinking the same thing.

694
01:02:11,957 --> 01:02:15,235
事实上，自从我来这儿就从没断过这样的念头
Actually, I've been thinking it ever since I got here.

695
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:20,143
为什么啊，为什么我当初不选蓝药丸呢?
Why, oh, why didn't I take the blue pill?

696
01:02:32,556 --> 01:02:34,475
活像喝尿，哈？
Good shit, huh?

697
01:02:34,768 --> 01:02:35,978
多泽酿的
Dozer makes it.

698
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:37,631
它只有两点用处：
It's good for two things:

699
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:40,882
引擎祛油和杀脑细胞
Degreasing engines and killing brain cells.

700
01:02:42,062 --> 01:02:44,219
嗯我能问你个问题吗？
So can I ask you something?

701
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:48,989
墨菲斯告诉你为什么要这么做了吗？
Did he tell you why he did it?

702
01:02:51,384 --> 01:02:53,219
为什么你会来到这儿？
Why you're here?

703
01:02:56,935 --> 01:02:58,687
上帝啊！
Jesus!

704
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:01,781
他这洗脑工作做的真好
What a mind job.

705
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,993
这么说，你来这儿是为了拯救世界
So you're here to save the world.

706
01:03:07,516 --> 01:03:09,602
对此，我还能说啥好呢？
What do you say to something like that?

707
01:03:14,734 --> 01:03:16,350
只能给个小小的建议吧
A little piece of advice.

708
01:03:17,762 --> 01:03:19,181
一看到特工……
You see an agent...

709
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,516
你还是像我们一样：
...you do what we do:

710
01:03:22,324 --> 01:03:23,702
拔腿就跑吧
Run.

711
01:03:24,353 --> 01:03:26,104
没命地逃啊
You run your ass off.

712
01:03:33,222 --> 01:03:34,769
谢谢你的饮料
Thanks for the drink.

713
01:03:39,738 --> 01:03:40,856
做个好梦
Sweet dreams.

714
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:48,158
我们谈妥了吗，里根先生？
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

715
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:49,931
要知道……
You know...

716
01:03:51,455 --> 01:03:53,820
我知道这块牛排并不存在
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

717
01:03:54,877 --> 01:03:57,550
我知道当我把它送入嘴里……
I know that when I put it in my mouth...

718
01:03:57,861 --> 01:04:01,187
矩阵会告诉我的大脑……
...the Matrix is telling my brain that it is...

719
01:04:01,225 --> 01:04:02,352
它多汁……
...juicy...

720
01:04:02,669 --> 01:04:04,380
又可口
...and delicious.

721
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:08,985
过了九年了……
After nine years...

722
01:04:09,667 --> 01:04:11,112
知道我终于想明白了什么吗？
...you know what I realize?

723
01:04:19,184 --> 01:04:20,697
无知是福
Ignorance is bliss.

724
01:04:25,235 --> 01:04:27,002
那么我们就说定了
Then we have a deal.

725
01:04:29,624 --> 01:04:31,535
我什么也不想记得
I don't want to remember nothing.

726
01:04:31,889 --> 01:04:34,204
忘掉一切  明白吗？
Nothing.  You understand?

727
01:04:38,302 --> 01:04:40,259
我还要变得富有
And I want to be rich.

728
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:44,130
做个有头有脸的人物
You know, someone important.

729
01:04:45,692 --> 01:04:46,818
比如当个演员
Like an actor.

730
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:51,109
想要什么都可以，里根先生
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

731
01:04:53,383 --> 01:04:54,702
Okay.

732
01:04:55,242 --> 01:04:57,489
把我的身体运回发电厂
You get my body back in a power plant...

733
01:04:58,151 --> 01:05:00,140
重新接入矩阵
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

734
01:05:00,165 --> 01:05:01,706
我就给你想要的东西
...I'II get you what you want.

735
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,872
锡安主机的接入密码
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

736
01:05:03,898 --> 01:05:06,227
办不到 我告诉过你，我也不知道
No. I told you, I don't know them.

737
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,083
但是我可以给你知道密码的人
I can get you the man who does.

738
01:05:11,912 --> 01:05:13,519
墨菲斯
Morpheus.

739
01:05:23,806 --> 01:05:26,966
给你，伙计  冠军早餐
Here you go, buddy.  Breakfast of champions.

740
01:05:28,623 --> 01:05:31,312
闭上眼睛的话，就像是吃软煎蛋
If you close your eyes, it feels like you're eating runny eggs.

741
01:05:31,337 --> 01:05:33,152
更像是一碗鼻涕
Or a bowl of snot.

742
01:05:33,911 --> 01:05:35,557
知道这让我想起来什么吗？
You know what it really reminds me of?

743
01:05:37,298 --> 01:05:39,725
味好美麦片  吃过吗？
Tastee Wheat. Did you ever eat Tastee Wheat?

744
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,003
没有，但从理论上说，你也没有真的吃过
No, but technically, neither did you.

745
01:05:42,028 --> 01:05:44,250
我想说的正是这个  正是！
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

746
01:05:44,514 --> 01:05:46,042
因为你现在想想……
Because you have to wonder, now...

747
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:49,253
机器又是怎么知道味好美麦片到底是什么味道呢？
...how do the machines really know what Tastee Wheat tasted like, huh?

748
01:05:49,617 --> 01:05:51,035
也许它们搞错了
Maybe they got it wrong.

749
01:05:51,378 --> 01:05:54,846
也许味好美麦片尝起来，实际上像是……
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat tasted like, actually tasted like...

750
01:05:54,871 --> 01:05:57,095
燕麦粥或者金枪鱼
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

751
01:05:57,266 --> 01:06:00,219
这就让人联想到很多东西  比如说吧，鸡肉
That makes you wonder about a lot of things. You take chicken for example.

752
01:06:00,244 --> 01:06:02,549
也许机器就搞不清楚鸡肉是什么味儿
Maybe they couldn't figure out what to make chicken taste like

753
01:06:02,574 --> 01:06:04,888
所以鸡肉才能有各种味道
...which is why it tastes like everything.

754
01:06:04,913 --> 01:06:07,141
-也许它们可以把你……  -闭嘴吧，耗子
-And maybe they can get you outs...  -Shut up, Mouse.

755
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,858
这是一种单细胞蛋白质……
It's a single-celled protein...

756
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:13,153
混合了人工合成的氨基酸、维生素和矿物质
...combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins and minerals.

757
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:14,707
包含了身体所需的一切
Everything the body needs.

758
01:06:14,732 --> 01:06:17,341
当然没有包含所需的一切
It doesn't have everything the body needs.

759
01:06:20,396 --> 01:06:23,815
听说你通过了特工训练程序
So I understand that you've run through the agent training program.

760
01:06:24,492 --> 01:06:26,749
知道吗，那程序是我写的
You know, I wrote that program.

761
01:06:26,873 --> 01:06:28,072
又来这套
Here it comes.

762
01:06:28,206 --> 01:06:30,278
-你觉得她怎么样？  -谁？
-So What did you think of her?  -Of who?

763
01:06:30,759 --> 01:06:33,804
红衣女郎啊  她是我设计的
The woman in the red dress.  I designed her.

764
01:06:34,085 --> 01:06:37,010
她话不多，但要是……
She doesn't talk very much, but...

765
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:41,222
要是你想见她，我还能安排你们私下幽会呢
...but if you'd like to meet her, I can arrange a more personal milieu.

766
01:06:41,253 --> 01:06:43,031
这数字皮条客干的真起劲呢
The digital pimp hard at work.

767
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:45,357
别理这些伪君子，尼奥
Pay no attention to these hypocrites, Neo.

768
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:48,396
否认自己的生理本能……
To deny our own impulses...

769
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:51,596
就是否认自己的人性
...is to deny the very thing that makes us human.

770
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:55,262
多泽，吃完之后
Dozer, when you're done...

771
01:06:55,287 --> 01:06:57,236
把船开到可以广播信号的深度
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

772
01:06:57,371 --> 01:06:58,575
我们要进矩阵
We're going in.

773
01:06:59,502 --> 01:07:00,881
带尼奥去见她
I'm taking Neo to see her.

774
01:07:05,326 --> 01:07:06,408
见谁？
See who?

775
01:07:07,006 --> 01:07:08,044
先知
The Oracle.

776
01:07:13,769 --> 01:07:15,313
乘客们请注意
Everyone please observe...

777
01:07:15,606 --> 01:07:18,760
"系好安全带"和"请勿吸烟"指示灯已亮
...the "fasten seat belt" and "no smoking" signs are on.

778
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:22,163
请坐稳  祝大家旅途愉快
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

779
01:07:47,024 --> 01:07:47,790
进来了
We're in.

780
01:08:03,432 --> 01:08:04,679
我们一个小时之后就回来
We'll be back in an hour.

781
01:08:19,238 --> 01:08:20,804
难以置信……
Unbelievable...

782
01:08:21,584 --> 01:08:22,578
不是吗？
...isn't it?

783
01:08:26,465 --> 01:08:28,300
-天呐  -怎么了？
-God!  -What?

784
01:08:28,914 --> 01:08:30,290
我在那家店吃过饭
I used to eat there.

785
01:08:32,556 --> 01:08:34,094
面条真是不错
Really good noodles.

786
01:08:38,919 --> 01:08:41,339
我一生中的这么多记忆
I have these memories from my life.

787
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,384
竟都不是真实发生的
None of them happened.

788
01:08:46,537 --> 01:08:47,724
这意味着什么呢？
What does that mean?

789
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:49,964
矩阵无法告诉你你是谁
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.

790
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:52,520
先知就可以吗？
But an oracle can?

791
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,755
这是两码事
That's different.

792
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,251
你去见过她吗
Did you go to her?

793
01:09:01,309 --> 01:09:02,182
见过
Yes.

794
01:09:02,996 --> 01:09:04,373
她跟你说了些什么？
What did she tell you?

795
01:09:07,486 --> 01:09:08,988
她告诉我……
She told me...

796
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,318
告诉什么？
What?

797
01:09:15,161 --> 01:09:16,345
到地方了
We're here.

798
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:19,030
尼奥，跟我来
Neo, come with me.

799
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,469
所以这是同一个先知吗，跟那个作出……
So is this the same oracle that made the ...

800
01:09:42,223 --> 01:09:43,250
救世主的预言？
...the prophecy?

801
01:09:43,275 --> 01:09:47,230
是同一个  她很老了  从一开始她就与我们同在
Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.

802
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,982
-什么的一开始？  -抵抗运动
-The beginning?  -Of the Resistance.

803
01:09:52,274 --> 01:09:55,055
她都知道什么?  任何事情？
And she knows what?  Everything?

804
01:09:56,615 --> 01:09:58,500
用她的话说就是“一切需要她知道事”
She would say she knows enough.

805
01:09:59,713 --> 01:10:01,466
而且从未出错？
And she's never wrong.

806
01:10:03,791 --> 01:10:06,403
不要总想着对与错
Try not to think of it in terms of right and wrong.

807
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:08,746
她只是个指路人，尼奥
She is a guide, Neo.

808
01:10:09,201 --> 01:10:11,077
指引你该走哪条路
She can help you to find the path.

809
01:10:11,851 --> 01:10:13,102
她帮助过你？
She helped you?

810
01:10:13,556 --> 01:10:14,483
没错
Yes.

811
01:10:15,219 --> 01:10:16,553
她对你怎么说？
What did she tell you?

812
01:10:19,187 --> 01:10:20,704
她说我会找到救世主
That I would find the One.

813
01:10:34,483 --> 01:10:36,930
我说过我只能将你领到门口
I told you I can only show you the door.

814
01:10:37,206 --> 01:10:39,216
你得自己走进去
You have to walk through it.

815
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,140
你好，尼奥
Hello, Neo.

816
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:45,993
你来的正是时候
You're right on time.

817
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,787
请自便，墨菲斯   尼奥，跟我来
Make yourself at home, Morpheus. Neo, come with me.

818
01:11:03,582 --> 01:11:05,419
这些是其他候选人
These are the other Potentials.

819
01:11:05,444 --> 01:11:06,870
你可以在这里等候
You can wait here.

820
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,264
不要想着弄弯勺子
Do not try and bend the spoon.

821
01:11:50,713 --> 01:11:52,773
那是不可能的
That's impossible.

822
01:11:53,674 --> 01:11:57,533
而是要认清这个事实
Instead, only try to realize the truth.

823
01:11:58,213 --> 01:11:59,506
什么事实？
What truth?

824
01:11:59,853 --> 01:12:01,521
根本没有勺子
There is no spoon.

825
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,620
没有勺子？
There is no spoon?

826
01:12:05,762 --> 01:12:10,302
你就会明白：弯曲的不是勺子，而是你自己
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends.  It is only yourself.

827
01:12:26,193 --> 01:12:27,586
现在先知可以见你了
The Oracle will you see now.

828
01:12:38,358 --> 01:12:39,902
我知道你叫尼奥
I know you're Neo.

829
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:41,775
请稍等片刻
Be right with you.

830
01:12:42,885 --> 01:12:45,305
-你就是先知？  -猜对了
-You're the Oracle?  -Bingo.

831
01:12:47,853 --> 01:12:50,512
跟你想象的不一样，对吧？
Not quite what you were expecting, right?

832
01:12:51,821 --> 01:12:53,990
就快好了
Almost done.

833
01:12:56,578 --> 01:12:58,205
闻起来很香吧？
Smell good, don't they?

834
01:12:59,831 --> 01:13:00,837
对
Yeah.

835
01:13:00,904 --> 01:13:02,753
我本来是要请你坐下的……
I'd ask you to sit down...

836
01:13:02,816 --> 01:13:05,036
不过反正你也不会坐的
...but you're not going to anyway.

837
01:13:05,821 --> 01:13:08,794
-还有不用担心花瓶的事  -什么花瓶？
-And don't worry about the vase.  -What vase?

838
01:13:11,814 --> 01:13:12,982
那个花瓶
That vase.

839
01:13:13,955 --> 01:13:14,998
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

840
01:13:15,267 --> 01:13:17,338
我说了，没关系的
I said, don't worry about it.

841
01:13:18,403 --> 01:13:20,584
我会让孩子们修好它的
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

842
01:13:20,888 --> 01:13:21,995
你怎么知道的？
How did you know?

843
01:13:24,064 --> 01:13:27,810
真正会让你苦思冥想的是……
What's really going to bake your noodle later on is...

844
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:31,233
如果我不去提它，你还会打碎它吗？
...would you still have broken it if I hadn't said anything?

845
01:13:35,992 --> 01:13:37,910
你比我预想的还要可爱
You're cuter than I thought.

846
01:13:40,974 --> 01:13:43,277
我明白她为什么喜欢你了
I can see why she likes you.

847
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:45,146
谁？
Who?

848
01:13:45,378 --> 01:13:47,161
可惜不怎么聪明
Not too bright, though.

849
01:13:50,587 --> 01:13:53,340
你知道为什么墨菲斯带你来见我
You know why Morpheus brought you to see me.

850
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:56,889
那么……
So...

851
01:13:57,913 --> 01:13:59,290
你自己怎么想的？
...what do you think?

852
01:14:01,126 --> 01:14:02,873
你觉得自己是救世主吗？
Do you think you are the One?

853
01:14:04,851 --> 01:14:05,940
老实说  我不知道
Honestly I don't know.

854
01:14:09,295 --> 01:14:10,713
知道那几个字是什么意思吗？
You know what that means?

855
01:14:11,486 --> 01:14:12,654
是拉丁文
It's Latin.

856
01:14:13,056 --> 01:14:15,385
意思是，“认识你自己”
Means, "Know thyself."

857
01:14:16,879 --> 01:14:18,871
让我告诉你个小秘密吧
I'll let you in on a little secret.

858
01:14:20,973 --> 01:14:24,684
做救世主就像谈恋爱一样
Being the One is just like being in love.

859
01:14:25,512 --> 01:14:28,390
没人会提醒你陷入爱河了  但你自己就是知道……
No one can tell you you're in love. You just know it...

860
01:14:28,613 --> 01:14:29,740
从头到尾……
...through and through.

861
01:14:30,073 --> 01:14:32,117
刻骨铭心
Balls to bones.

862
01:14:34,773 --> 01:14:35,815
好吧……
Well...

863
01:14:37,457 --> 01:14:39,542
我得好好看看你
...I'd better have a look at you.

864
01:14:40,936 --> 01:14:42,526
张嘴，说“啊~”
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

865
01:14:56,761 --> 01:14:58,290
好吧
Okay...

866
01:14:59,068 --> 01:15:04,204
现在我得说“嗯，挺有意思的，不过……”
Now I'm supposed to say, "Hmm , that's interesting , but..."

867
01:15:04,564 --> 01:15:05,839
而你会问：
Then you say:

868
01:15:06,533 --> 01:15:07,687
不过什么？
But what?

869
01:15:07,819 --> 01:15:11,445
不过你已经知道我要说什么了
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.

870
01:15:13,164 --> 01:15:16,075
-我不是救世主  -很遗憾，孩子
-I'm not the One.  -Sorry, kid.

871
01:15:17,744 --> 01:15:19,746
你有天分……
You got the gift...

872
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:23,086
但看起来你在等待什么
...but it looks like you're waiting for something.

873
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:28,584
在等什么？
What?

874
01:15:28,609 --> 01:15:31,736
等下辈子吧，大概，谁知道呢？
（双关：next life 亦指代死后的新生）
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

875
01:15:32,365 --> 01:15:34,618
事情总是不尽如人意
That's the way these things go.

876
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,966
-你在笑什么？  -墨菲斯……
-What's funny?  -Morpheus.

877
01:15:41,554 --> 01:15:43,431
他几乎让我信以为真了
He almost had me convinced.

878
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:44,582
我明白
I know.

879
01:15:46,204 --> 01:15:48,263
可怜的墨菲斯
Poor Morpheus.

880
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:53,758
（Morpheus 一名取自希腊神话的梦神，即“造梦者”）
要是没有他，我们就迷失了
Without him, we're lost.

881
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:57,509
“要是没有他”，你是指什么？
What do you mean, "without him"?

882
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:03,458
你真的想听吗？
Are you sure you want to hear this?

883
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:08,324
墨菲斯相信你，尼奥
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

884
01:16:10,185 --> 01:16:12,563
没有人，甚至你我都不能……
And no one, not you, not even me...

885
01:16:12,588 --> 01:16:14,737
动摇他的信念
...can convince him otherwise.

886
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:17,478
他如此盲目地相信你就是救世主……
He believes it so blindly...

887
01:16:17,895 --> 01:16:22,199
以至于愿意牺牲自己拯救你的生命
...that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.

888
01:16:22,525 --> 01:16:23,439
什么？
What?

889
01:16:23,464 --> 01:16:26,332
你将不得不做出选择
You're going to have to make a choice.

890
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:30,535
一边是墨菲斯的性命
In the one hand, you'll have Morpheus' life.

891
01:16:31,078 --> 01:16:34,165
一边是你自己的
And in the other hand, you'll have your own.

892
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,635
你们中的一个会死
One of you is going to die.

893
01:16:39,793 --> 01:16:43,088
至于哪一个，将取决于你
Which one will be up to you.

894
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:46,535
我很抱歉，孩子  真的
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.

895
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,229
你有颗善良的心
You have a good soul.

896
01:16:49,366 --> 01:16:52,360
我最讨厌告诉好人坏消息了
And I hate giving good people bad news.

897
01:16:55,245 --> 01:16:56,731
别担心了
Don't worry about it.

898
01:16:56,756 --> 01:16:59,281
只要你一离开这扇门……
As soon as you step outside that door...

899
01:16:59,578 --> 01:17:01,656
就会感觉好些的
...you'll start feeling better.

900
01:17:02,507 --> 01:17:06,214
你会记起，自己从来不信宿命论这种鬼话
You'll remember you don't believe in any of this fate crap.

901
01:17:07,069 --> 01:17:09,701
你可是说过要掌控自己的人生
You're in control of your own life.

902
01:17:10,657 --> 01:17:11,878
还记得吗？
Remember?

903
01:17:13,785 --> 01:17:14,945
过来……
Here...

904
01:17:16,651 --> 01:17:18,194
拿块曲奇吧
（双关：cookie 亦指互联网中每个用户的特异性身份识别码）
...take a cookie.

905
01:17:18,836 --> 01:17:22,173
我保证，只要一吃下它……
I promise, by the time you're done eating it...

906
01:17:23,066 --> 01:17:25,444
你的心情就和往常一样好了
...you'll feel right as rain.

907
01:17:34,648 --> 01:17:35,941
她说过的话……
What was said...

908
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:37,949
就是给你的
...was for you...

909
01:17:38,624 --> 01:17:40,375
只说给你一个人听
...and for you alone.

910
01:18:03,465 --> 01:18:04,591
他们在回来的路上了
They're on the way.

911
01:18:34,757 --> 01:18:35,637
那是什么？
What is that?

912
01:18:50,018 --> 01:18:51,905
（Déjà vu 法语 即 "already seen"）
哦  似曾相识
Oh, Déjà vu.

913
01:18:55,087 --> 01:18:56,172
你说什么？
What did you just say?

914
01:18:56,261 --> 01:18:58,042
没什么  就是有点似曾相识
Nothing.   Just having a little Déjà vu.

915
01:18:58,267 --> 01:18:59,893
你看见什么了？ 发生什么了？
What did you see?  What happened?

916
01:19:01,224 --> 01:19:03,393
刚才有只黑猫走过
A black cat went past us...

917
01:19:03,683 --> 01:19:05,382
然后又过去一只一模一样的
...then another just like it.

918
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,305
有多像？  是同一只猫吗？
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?

919
01:19:08,265 --> 01:19:11,255
-好像是的  我不确定  -斯维奇，艾波克
-Might have been.  I'm not sure.  -Switch, Apoc.

920
01:19:15,494 --> 01:19:16,042
这是什么？
What is it?

921
01:19:16,067 --> 01:19:19,910
这种似曾相识通常是矩阵被修改时出的小故障
A Déjà vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix when they change something.

922
01:19:24,261 --> 01:19:25,381
上帝啊！
Oh, my God.

923
01:19:27,066 --> 01:19:27,895
我们走
Let's go.

924
01:19:33,069 --> 01:19:34,862
他们把电话线剪断了  是陷阱！  快跑!
They cut the hard line.  It's a trap! Get out!

925
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:41,851
哦不！
Oh, no.

926
01:20:21,808 --> 01:20:24,583
他们修改了这儿  咱们困在这出不去了
That's what they changed.  We're trapped.

927
01:20:24,608 --> 01:20:26,636
冷静！ 把手机给我
Be calm. Give me your phone.

928
01:20:26,661 --> 01:20:28,382
他们会追踪到的
They'll be able to track it.

929
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:29,801
没别的选择了
We have no choice.

930
01:20:31,276 --> 01:20:32,592
-接线员  -坦克
-Operator.  -Tank…

931
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,648
找一下这栋楼的结构图纸  要快！
Find a structural drawing of this building.  Find it fast.

932
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:46,057
-找到了！  -主管道墙在哪
-Got it!  -l need the main wet-wall.

933
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:50,545
在八楼
Eighth floor.

934
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:51,930
他们在八楼
They're on the eighth floor.

935
01:20:52,289 --> 01:20:53,678
斯维奇，直走
Switch, straight ahead.

936
01:20:54,453 --> 01:20:57,712
（Apoc 一名取自圣经《启示录》<i>apocalypse</i> 中宣告末日的黑暗天使“天启”， 对应此处正是他交了尼奥第一把武器）
尼奥
Neo...

937
01:21:01,777 --> 01:21:03,938
希望先知跟你说的是好消息
I hope the Oracle gave you some good news.

938
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,605
现在左转  那就是了
Now left. That's it.

939
01:21:14,091 --> 01:21:14,932
很好
Good.

940
01:21:24,759 --> 01:21:26,052
他们去哪了？
Where are they?

941
01:22:26,561 --> 01:22:27,728
在墙壁里
They're in the walls.

942
01:22:29,155 --> 01:22:30,323
在墙里！
In the walls!

943
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:53,339
是特工！
It's an agent!

944
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:01,767
墨菲斯！
Morpheus!

945
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:03,741
崔尼蒂  你们必须带上尼奥走！
Trinity.  You must get Neo out!

946
01:23:03,766 --> 01:23:05,759
-他才是最重要的人！  -不！
-He's all that matters!  -No!

947
01:23:05,938 --> 01:23:08,498
-不  墨菲斯  不要！  -崔尼蒂，快走！
-No, Morpheus! Don't!  -Trinity, go!

948
01:23:08,968 --> 01:23:09,851
Go!

949
01:23:16,539 --> 01:23:18,425
-我们不能丢下他！  -我们只能这么做了！
-We can't leave him!  -We have to!

950
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:44,819
赛弗，快来啊！
Cypher, come on!

951
01:23:49,568 --> 01:23:53,795
伟大的墨菲斯  我们终于见面了
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.

952
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:54,947
你是哪位？
And you are?

953
01:23:55,243 --> 01:23:56,799
史密斯
A Smith.

954
01:23:57,259 --> 01:23:58,552
史密斯特工
Agent Smith.

955
01:23:59,169 --> 01:24:01,243
我看你们长得都一样
You all look the same to me.

956
01:24:56,857 --> 01:24:58,124
交给你们了
Take him.

957
01:25:04,856 --> 01:25:06,236
No!

958
01:25:11,358 --> 01:25:13,312
-接线员  -我需要出口，快
-Operator.  -l need an exit, fast.

959
01:25:13,558 --> 01:25:15,059
-塞弗？  -是我
-Cypher?  -Yeah.

960
01:25:15,266 --> 01:25:18,307
刚才发生了意外  天杀的车祸
There was an accident.  Goddamn car accident.

961
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:20,142
突然就爆炸了
All of a sudden, boom.

962
01:25:20,563 --> 01:25:22,092
我还困在这呢
Somebody up there still likes me.

963
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,263
找到你了
I got you.

964
01:25:23,693 --> 01:25:25,611
赶紧把我弄出去
Just get me out of here fast.

965
01:25:26,199 --> 01:25:28,819
最近的出口在Franklin和Erie的街口  是间老旧的电视修理店
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.  An old TV repair shop.

966
01:25:29,022 --> 01:25:29,762
Right.

967
01:25:33,173 --> 01:25:34,758
-接线员  -坦克，是我
-Operator.  -Tank, it's me.

968
01:25:35,062 --> 01:25:36,230
墨菲斯还活着吗？
Is Morpheus alive?

969
01:25:36,586 --> 01:25:38,159
墨菲斯还活着吗，坦克？
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?

970
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:40,180
活着  他被带走了  我不知道是去哪
Yes. They're moving him.  l don 't know where.

971
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:42,638
他还活着  我们需要出口
He's alive. We need an exit.

972
01:25:42,968 --> 01:25:44,052
你们离赛弗不远
You're not far from Cypher.

973
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,616
-赛弗？  -想不到吧
-Cypher?  -I know.

974
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:47,726
-我让他去富兰克林和厄里街口了  -收到
-I sent him to Franklin and Erie.  -Got it.

975
01:25:56,958 --> 01:25:57,771
他回来了
Got him.

976
01:26:08,988 --> 01:26:10,031
他们在哪？
Where are they?

977
01:26:10,547 --> 01:26:11,708
正要接电话呢
Making the call.

978
01:26:12,253 --> 01:26:13,294
很好
Good.

979
01:26:27,133 --> 01:26:28,384
你先来，尼奥
You first, Neo.

980
01:26:30,976 --> 01:26:32,089
该死！
Shit!

981
01:26:35,659 --> 01:26:36,706
坦克！
Tank!

982
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,472
No!

983
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,821
我不知道  突然就断线了
I don't know. It just went dead.

984
01:27:09,853 --> 01:27:11,093
你好啊，崔尼蒂
Hello, Trinity.

985
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:13,193
（Cypher  最古早的意思是"zero", 0，对应了他成为"the One", 1的对立面） 
赛弗？  坦克去哪了？
Cypher?  Where's Tank?

986
01:27:18,391 --> 01:27:19,434
你知道吗……
You know...

987
01:27:21,038 --> 01:27:23,158
好久以来……
...for a long time...

988
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:27,325
我觉得自己爱上你了
...I thought I was in love with you.

989
01:27:28,191 --> 01:27:30,197
我总是会梦到你
I used to dream about you.

990
01:27:31,319 --> 01:27:33,854
你长得这么漂亮，崔尼蒂
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

991
01:27:34,327 --> 01:27:36,705
真可惜只能落得这步田地
Too bad things had to turn out this way.

992
01:27:37,487 --> 01:27:38,598
你杀了他们
You killed them.

993
01:27:38,751 --> 01:27:40,423
-什么？  -天呐
-What?  -Oh , God.

994
01:27:40,448 --> 01:27:41,866
我厌倦了，崔尼蒂
I'm tired, Trinity.

995
01:27:43,324 --> 01:27:45,201
我受够了这场战争……
I'm tired of this war...

996
01:27:45,547 --> 01:27:48,383
受够了搏斗  受够了这艘船……
...tired of fighting.  I'm tired of this ship...

997
01:27:48,642 --> 01:27:53,129
受够了挨冻，还有每天吃那恶心的糊糊
...of being cold, of eating the same goddamn goop every day.

998
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:57,154
但最主要的是……
But most of all...

999
01:27:57,179 --> 01:28:00,674
我受够了那个混蛋和他的屁话
...l'm tired of that jackoff and all of his bullshit.

1000
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:03,227
想不到吧，混蛋！
Surprise, asshole!

1001
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:05,697
没想到自己会有今天吧
I bet you never saw this coming...

1002
01:28:06,013 --> 01:28:07,000
是吧？
...did you?

1003
01:28:09,323 --> 01:28:11,604
天呐，我真希望能亲眼……
God, I wish I could be there...

1004
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:13,747
看着他们打垮你
...when they break you.

1005
01:28:14,876 --> 01:28:17,868
我希望能在你崩溃的那一刻走过去
I wish I could walk in just when it happens...

1006
01:28:18,754 --> 01:28:20,436
这样一来……
...so right then...

1007
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:22,188
你就会知道是我干的了
...you'd know it was me.

1008
01:28:22,742 --> 01:28:23,961
你把墨菲斯出卖给他们
You gave them Morpheus.

1009
01:28:23,986 --> 01:28:25,342
是他骗了我们，崔尼蒂
He lied to us, Trinity.

1010
01:28:26,024 --> 01:28:27,525
他把我们耍了！
He tricked us!

1011
01:28:28,049 --> 01:28:30,230
要是你早点告诉我们真相……
If you had told us the truth...

1012
01:28:30,316 --> 01:28:33,363
我们才不选他妈的红药丸呢！
...we would've told you to shove that red pill up your ass!

1013
01:28:33,388 --> 01:28:35,863
不是的，赛弗   他解放了我们
That is not true, Cypher.  He set us free.

1014
01:28:35,947 --> 01:28:38,826
“解放”  你管这叫“解放”？
"Free."  You call this free?

1015
01:28:41,097 --> 01:28:43,600
我每天就只能按他的指示行事
All I do is what he tells me to do.

1016
01:28:45,229 --> 01:28:48,082
要我在这里和矩阵之间选一个
If I had to choose between that and the Matrix...

1017
01:28:49,239 --> 01:28:50,691
我选择矩阵
...I choose the Matrix.

1018
01:28:50,716 --> 01:28:52,671
矩阵不是真实的
The Matrix isn't real.

1019
01:28:52,696 --> 01:28:53,995
我不这么看，崔尼蒂
I disagree, Trinity.

1020
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:56,543
我认为矩阵……
I think the Matrix...

1021
01:28:56,971 --> 01:28:59,482
可以比这个世界更真实
...can be more real than this world.

1022
01:29:01,685 --> 01:29:04,188
只要我在这边拔个插头
All I do is pull the plug here.

1023
01:29:04,789 --> 01:29:05,945
那边……
But there...

1024
01:29:06,263 --> 01:29:08,519
你就得看着艾波克死
...you have to watch Apoc die.

1025
01:29:10,143 --> 01:29:11,226
Trinity.

1026
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:19,361
-欢迎来到真实的世界  -可是你已经出来了，赛弗
-Welcome to the real world.  -But you're out, Cypher.

1027
01:29:19,386 --> 01:29:22,123
-你回不去了  -不，那只是你以为的
-You can 't go back.  -Oh, no.  That's what you think.

1028
01:29:22,201 --> 01:29:23,703
他们会把我的身体重新接入
They'll reinsert my body.

1029
01:29:23,939 --> 01:29:27,612
我会睡去  等我在矩阵中醒来，什么玩意都不会记得
I go back to sleep. When l wake up, l won 't remember a goddame thing.

1030
01:29:27,796 --> 01:29:28,839
顺便提一句
By the way...

1031
01:29:29,117 --> 01:29:32,166
你要是你有什么要紧的话想对斯维奇说……
...if you have anything terribly important
to say to Switch...

1032
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:33,537
最好现在就说吧
I suggest you say it now.

1033
01:29:33,565 --> 01:29:36,825
-哦不，求你不要这么做  -我不要像这样
-Oh. No, please don't.  -Not like this.

1034
01:29:38,615 --> 01:29:41,574
（Switch 一名直译为“反转”，暗示之后的情节
另外，在导演最初的设计中，她是跨性别人士，真实性别为男性，矩阵中是女性/自我认同为女性）
不要像这样死去
Not like this.

1035
01:29:44,764 --> 01:29:46,044
太迟了
Too late.

1036
01:29:46,069 --> 01:29:47,983
你个天杀的，赛弗！
Goddamn you , Cypher!

1037
01:29:48,054 --> 01:29:49,870
别恨我，崔妮蒂
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1038
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:52,089
我只是个提供情报的
I'm just a messenger.

1039
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:55,566
现在，我要证明给你看
And right now, I'm going to prove it to you.

1040
01:29:56,887 --> 01:29:58,555
如果墨菲斯是对的……
If Morpheus was right...

1041
01:29:59,078 --> 01:30:00,955
那我就拔不掉这个插头
...there's no way I can pull this plug.

1042
01:30:01,512 --> 01:30:03,014
如果尼奥真是救世主
I mean if Neo's the One...

1043
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:04,862
就一定会发生……
...then there'd have to be...

1044
01:30:04,887 --> 01:30:08,153
某个奇迹来阻止我
...some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1045
01:30:08,734 --> 01:30:09,707
是吧？
Right?

1046
01:30:10,241 --> 01:30:12,268
我是说，要是他死了……
I mean, how can he be the One...

1047
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:13,822
还怎么做救世主啊？
...if he's dead?

1048
01:30:15,013 --> 01:30:17,214
你以前从没回答过我……
You never did answer me before...

1049
01:30:17,518 --> 01:30:19,854
你到底信不信墨菲斯的鬼话？
...if you bought into Morpheus' bullshit.

1050
01:30:20,242 --> 01:30:23,370
说嘛  我只想听信还是不信
Come on.  All I want is a little yes or no.

1051
01:30:24,724 --> 01:30:27,060
看着他的眼睛……
Look into his eyes...

1052
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:29,912
那双又大又迷人的眼睛
...those big, pretty eyes...

1053
01:30:32,052 --> 01:30:33,386
然后告诉我……
...and tell me...

1054
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:35,380
信……
...yes...

1055
01:30:35,732 --> 01:30:37,109
……还是不信
...or no.

1056
01:30:38,383 --> 01:30:40,068
-我信  -不！
-Yes.  -No!

1057
01:30:40,146 --> 01:30:41,313
我不相信
I don't believe it.

1058
01:30:42,805 --> 01:30:47,162
不管信不信，你个混蛋，你都是要被烧死的！
Believe it or not, you piece of shit, you're still going to burn!

1059
01:31:06,162 --> 01:31:07,209
你先走
You first.

1060
01:31:15,347 --> 01:31:17,641
-你受伤了  -我会没事的
-You're hurt.  -I'll be all right.

1061
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:21,576
多泽怎么样？
Dozer?

1062
01:31:39,812 --> 01:31:42,939
你有过就这么站在这儿凝视这它吗？
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1063
01:31:43,058 --> 01:31:46,518
惊叹于它的美丽……
Marveled at its beauty...

1064
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:48,710
它的天才？
...its genius?

1065
01:31:50,042 --> 01:31:51,565
数以亿计的人们……
Billions of people...

1066
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:54,645
就在这里生活着
...just living out their lives.

1067
01:31:55,911 --> 01:31:57,675
一无所知
Oblivious.

1068
01:32:02,208 --> 01:32:05,086
你知不知道第一代矩阵……
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1069
01:32:05,582 --> 01:32:10,456
被设计成一个完美的人类世界  在那里无人受苦……
...was designed to be a perfect human world where none suffered...

1070
01:32:10,541 --> 01:32:13,392
人人都很幸福
...where everyone would be happy.

1071
01:32:13,988 --> 01:32:15,630
结果却是场灾难
It was a disaster.

1072
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:19,827
没人能接受那个程序  一整茬“庄稼”都报废了
No one would accept the program.  Entire crops were lost.

1073
01:32:20,982 --> 01:32:22,846
有些人认为……
Some believe that...

1074
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:27,475
我们缺乏那种用来描述你们的完美世界的编程语言
...we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world.

1075
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,594
但是我相信……
But I believe that...

1076
01:32:29,619 --> 01:32:30,647
作为一个物种……
...as a species...

1077
01:32:30,672 --> 01:32:34,691
人类是靠苦难和……
...human beings define their reality through misery...

1078
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:36,092
折磨来界定“真实”的
...and suffering.

1079
01:32:36,404 --> 01:32:38,697
因此那个完美的世界只是一个……
So the perfect world was a dream...

1080
01:32:38,722 --> 01:32:44,142
让你们那原始的大脑拼命想醒过来的梦
...that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.

1081
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:49,581
这就是为什么矩阵被重新设计成了这样
Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this.

1082
01:32:49,646 --> 01:32:51,332
你们文明的巅峰……
The peak...

1083
01:32:51,357 --> 01:32:53,001
...of your civilization.

1084
01:32:53,026 --> 01:32:55,541
我得用"你们的文明"一词……
I say, "your civilization"...

1085
01:32:55,566 --> 01:32:59,942
因为一旦我们开始代替你们思考，这事实上就变成了我们的文明
...because as soon as we started thinking for you, it really became our civilization...

1086
01:32:59,967 --> 01:33:03,920
当然了，正是周围发生的这样
...which is, of course, what this is all about.

1087
01:33:04,414 --> 01:33:06,969
这就是进化，墨菲斯
Evolution, Morpheus.

1088
01:33:07,253 --> 01:33:08,587
进化
Evolution.

1089
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:12,712
就好比恐龙的灭绝
Like the dinosaur.

1090
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:16,508
看看窗外吧
Look out that window.

1091
01:33:17,290 --> 01:33:19,363
你们有过自己的时代
You had your time.

1092
01:33:20,154 --> 01:33:24,282
未来已是我们的天下，墨菲斯
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1093
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:26,744
未来，是我们的时代
The future is our time.

1094
01:33:30,965 --> 01:33:32,146
可能出问题了
There could be a problem.

1095
01:33:33,071 --> 01:33:36,628
-他们要对他做什么？  -他们在入侵他的意识
-What are they doing to him?  -They're breaking into his mind.

1096
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:39,047
就跟黑入电脑一样  入侵成功只是时间问题
It's like hacking a computer.  All it takes is time.

1097
01:33:39,264 --> 01:33:40,473
要花多久？
How much time?

1098
01:33:40,584 --> 01:33:43,885
取决于他的意志力  但头脑早晚会被撬开……
Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it'll crack...

1099
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:48,263
他的α脑电波就会变成这样
...and his alpha patterns will change from this to this.

1100
01:33:48,858 --> 01:33:51,753
到时候，他什么都会交代的
When it does, he'll tell them anything they want to know.

1101
01:33:51,879 --> 01:33:52,976
他们想要什么？
And what do they want?

1102
01:33:53,099 --> 01:33:57,370
每个舰长都有锡安主机的接入密钥
The leader of every ship is given codes to Zion's mainframe computer.

1103
01:33:57,462 --> 01:34:00,482
如果特工得到了密钥，进入了锡安主机
If an agent got the codes and got into Zion's mainframe...

1104
01:34:00,545 --> 01:34:03,470
我们就全完了  不能让这种事情发生
...they could destroy us.  We can't let that happen.

1105
01:34:03,546 --> 01:34:06,199
崔尼蒂，锡安的重要性远远超过我……
Trinity, Zion's more important than me...

1106
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:07,392
还有你……
...or you...

1107
01:34:07,612 --> 01:34:08,905
甚至是墨菲斯
...or even Morpheus.

1108
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,707
一定还有什么我们可以做的
There has to be something we can do.

1109
01:34:14,785 --> 01:34:16,902
是的  拔掉插头
There is.  We pull the plug.

1110
01:34:19,888 --> 01:34:21,640
你要杀了他？
You're gonna kill him?

1111
01:34:21,849 --> 01:34:23,041
杀死墨菲斯？
Kill Morpheus?

1112
01:34:23,709 --> 01:34:25,336
我们别无选择
We don't have any other choice.

1113
01:34:32,081 --> 01:34:35,150
永远不该让人类做机器的工作
Never send a human to do a machine's job.

1114
01:34:35,364 --> 01:34:37,116
如果线人真的失败了……
If indeed the insider has failed...

1115
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:40,737
他们会尽快切断连接，除非……
...they'll sever the connection as soon as possible, unless---

1116
01:34:40,762 --> 01:34:42,610
他们全死了  不管怎样……
They're dead.  In either case---

1117
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:46,406
我们别无选择，只有按原计划进行  派出哨兵
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels.

1118
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:47,515
立刻
Immediately.

1119
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:55,390
墨菲斯，你不仅仅是我们的领袖
Morpheus, you were more than a leader to us.

1120
01:34:56,425 --> 01:34:58,821
更像是我们的父亲
You were a father.

1121
01:35:00,252 --> 01:35:02,212
我们会永远怀念你
We'll miss you always.

1122
01:35:09,241 --> 01:35:10,348
住手！
Stop!

1123
01:35:11,399 --> 01:35:12,849
我不敢相信这真的发生了
I don't believe this is happening.

1124
01:35:13,027 --> 01:35:15,027
-尼奥，必须这么做  -真的吗？
-Neo, this has to be done.  -Does it?

1125
01:35:15,730 --> 01:35:17,106
我不知道  我……
I don't know. I...

1126
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:20,289
-这不可能只是巧合  不可能  -你在说什么？
-This can't be just coincidence. It can't be...  -What? What are you talking about?

1127
01:35:20,533 --> 01:35:21,566
先知
The Oracle.

1128
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:23,384
她预言了这个
She told me this would happen.

1129
01:35:23,854 --> 01:35:28,025
她说过，我将不得不做出选择
She told me, that I would have to make a choice.

1130
01:35:28,484 --> 01:35:29,694
什么选择？
What choice?

1131
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:35,172
-你要干什么？  -我要进去
-What are you doing?  -I'm going in.

1132
01:35:35,499 --> 01:35:38,005
-不，你不可以  -我必须这么做
-No, you're not.  -I have to.

1133
01:35:38,102 --> 01:35:41,911
尼奥，墨菲斯牺牲自己，就是让我们能带你出来
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself so that we could get you out.

1134
01:35:41,981 --> 01:35:44,048
绝不可以再让你回去
There is no way that you're going back in.

1135
01:35:44,477 --> 01:35:48,118
墨菲斯那么做是因为他错信了我的身份
Morpheus did what he did because he believed I'm something I'm not.

1136
01:35:49,666 --> 01:35:50,619
什么？
What?

1137
01:35:50,952 --> 01:35:52,578
我并不是救世主
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1138
01:35:52,992 --> 01:35:56,082
-先知说时我也很吃惊  -不，你必须是
-The Oracle hit me with that too.  -No, you have to be.

1139
01:35:56,252 --> 01:35:58,922
很抱歉，我真的不是  我不过是个普通人
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.

1140
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:00,946
不，尼奥，那不是真的
No, Neo, that's not true.

1141
01:36:01,349 --> 01:36:03,977
-不可能是真的  -为什么？
-It can't be true.  -Why?

1142
01:36:07,665 --> 01:36:12,019
尼奥，这是发疯  他们把墨菲斯关在有军队把守的大楼里
Neo, this is Loco. They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.

1143
01:36:12,044 --> 01:36:16,619
即便你有办法进到楼里，也有特工在看守他  三个都在
Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him. Three of them.

1144
01:36:17,830 --> 01:36:21,691
我也想要墨菲斯回来，但你就是在送死
I want Morpheus back too, but what you're talking about is suicide.

1145
01:36:21,716 --> 01:36:23,503
我知道看起来是这样
I know that's what it looks like...

1146
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:24,682
但真的不是
...but it's not.

1147
01:36:24,947 --> 01:36:27,213
我没法跟你解释为什么
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1148
01:36:28,302 --> 01:36:32,354
墨菲斯有一个信念，他甚至愿意为此付出生命
Morpheus believed something, and he was ready to give his life for it.

1149
01:36:32,379 --> 01:36:35,661
现在我能理解他了  所以我必须去
I understand that now.  That's why I have to go.

1150
01:36:35,686 --> 01:36:38,100
-为什么  -因为我只相信这件事
-Why?  -Because I believe in something.

1151
01:36:38,588 --> 01:36:39,766
相信什么？
What?

1152
01:36:40,577 --> 01:36:42,287
我相信我能带他回来
I believe I can bring him back.

1153
01:36:59,497 --> 01:37:01,663
-你要干什么？  -跟你一起去
-What are you doing?  -Going with you.

1154
01:37:01,688 --> 01:37:03,650
-不行  -“不行”？
-No, you're not.  -"No"?

1155
01:37:04,763 --> 01:37:06,891
我来告诉你我相信什么
Let me tell you what I believe.

1156
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,769
墨菲斯在我心中比在你心中还要重要
I believe Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1157
01:37:09,995 --> 01:37:14,215
如果你真想救出他，你会需要我的帮助的
I believe if you are serious about saving him, you will need my help.

1158
01:37:14,535 --> 01:37:16,862
而且我现在是舰上的最高长官
And since I am the ranking officer on this ship...

1159
01:37:16,887 --> 01:37:19,667
你要是不喜欢这样，那就下地狱吧
...if you don't like it, I believe you can go to hell.

1160
01:37:20,544 --> 01:37:22,914
因为你也没别的地方去了
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1161
01:37:23,366 --> 01:37:24,812
Tank...

1162
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:26,072
让我们进去
...Load us up.

1163
01:37:35,738 --> 01:37:39,183
我想跟你分享一下我在这里
I'd like to share a revelation that I've had...

1164
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:40,980
悟出的一个道理
...during my time here.

1165
01:37:41,304 --> 01:37:45,799
是我在试图给你们的物种分类时想到的
It came to me when I tried to classify your species...

1166
01:37:45,824 --> 01:37:47,962
我意识到……
...and I realized that...

1167
01:37:47,987 --> 01:37:50,281
你们根本算不上哺乳动物
...that you're not actually mammals.

1168
01:37:52,551 --> 01:37:55,011
这个星球上所有的哺乳动物……
Every mammal on this planet...

1169
01:37:55,391 --> 01:38:00,466
都本能地会与周围环境建立平衡
...instinctively develops an equilibrium with the surrounding environment.

1170
01:38:00,491 --> 01:38:02,537
你们人类却不会这样
But you humans do not.

1171
01:38:02,907 --> 01:38:06,606
你们每到一个地区，就开始繁殖
You move to an area and you multiply...

1172
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:11,069
不停地繁殖，直到一切自然资源枯竭
...and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.

1173
01:38:11,562 --> 01:38:14,047
你们继续生存的唯一途径……
The only way you can survive...

1174
01:38:14,072 --> 01:38:17,008
就是扩散到另一个地方
...is to spread to another area.

1175
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,826
这个星球上还有一个物种……
There is another organism on this planet...

1176
01:38:24,851 --> 01:38:27,586
采取了相同的生产模式
...that follows the same pattern.

1177
01:38:27,997 --> 01:38:29,589
知道是什么吗？
Do you know what it is?

1178
01:38:30,153 --> 01:38:31,949
病毒
A virus.

1179
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:36,552
人类就是一种疾病
Human beings are a disease.

1180
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:38,482
是地球之癌
A cancer of this planet.

1181
01:38:38,507 --> 01:38:40,498
你们就是瘟疫
You are a plague.

1182
01:38:41,066 --> 01:38:42,600
而我们……
And we...

1183
01:38:42,651 --> 01:38:44,150
则是解药
...are the cure.

1184
01:38:45,095 --> 01:38:46,843
好吧，你们还需要什么？
Okay, so what do you need?

1185
01:38:47,086 --> 01:38:48,285
除了奇迹之外
Besides a miracle.

1186
01:38:48,816 --> 01:38:49,945
枪
Guns.

1187
01:38:51,038 --> 01:38:52,132
很多的枪
Lots of guns.

1188
01:39:02,134 --> 01:39:03,147
Neo...

1189
01:39:04,969 --> 01:39:07,000
没有人干过这种事
No one has ever done anything like this.

1190
01:39:08,702 --> 01:39:10,562
这就是为什么我们能成功的
That's why it's going to work.

1191
01:39:14,661 --> 01:39:16,768
血清怎么不起作用呢？
Why isn't the serum working?

1192
01:39:17,239 --> 01:39:19,774
或许我们问错了问题
Perhaps we're asking the wrong questions.

1193
01:39:21,592 --> 01:39:22,912
让我一个人跟他谈谈
Leave me with him.

1194
01:39:25,423 --> 01:39:26,363
马上
Now.

1195
01:39:37,762 --> 01:39:39,347
撑住啊，墨菲斯
Hold on, Morpheus.

1196
01:39:39,677 --> 01:39:42,388
他们马上去救你了  快了
They're coming for you.  They're coming.

1197
01:39:44,678 --> 01:39:46,678
能听见我说话吗，墨菲斯？
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1198
01:39:47,170 --> 01:39:49,736
让我跟你……
I'm going to be honest...

1199
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:51,250
坦白吧……
...with you.

1200
01:39:55,756 --> 01:39:57,174
我……
I...

1201
01:39:58,176 --> 01:39:59,302
恨透……
...hate...

1202
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:01,380
这个地方了
...this place...

1203
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:04,217
这个动物园
...this zoo...

1204
01:40:04,242 --> 01:40:05,582
这座监狱……
...this prison...

1205
01:40:05,607 --> 01:40:09,155
这种“现实”，你怎么叫它都行
...this reality, whatever you want to call it.

1206
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:11,255
我再也受不了了
I can't stand it any longer.

1207
01:40:12,079 --> 01:40:13,956
这种气味
It's the smell.

1208
01:40:15,285 --> 01:40:17,162
如果真有这种东西的话
If there is such a thing.

1209
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:20,834
我已经它被熏透了
I feel saturated by it.

1210
01:40:22,326 --> 01:40:23,552
我能……
I can...

1211
01:40:24,161 --> 01:40:25,580
闻到……
...taste...

1212
01:40:25,605 --> 01:40:27,563
你的恶臭
...your stink.

1213
01:40:27,813 --> 01:40:31,749
每次我闻到，我都担心自己被它传染
And every time I do, I fear that I have somehow been infected by it.

1214
01:40:31,774 --> 01:40:32,887
真是恶心
It's repulsive.

1215
01:40:33,684 --> 01:40:34,987
不是吗？
Isn't it?

1216
01:40:37,255 --> 01:40:39,619
我必须离开这里
I must get out of here.

1217
01:40:39,913 --> 01:40:42,124
我必须获得自由
I must get free.

1218
01:40:42,441 --> 01:40:45,431
而钥匙就在你的脑子里
And in this mind is the key.

1219
01:40:45,456 --> 01:40:46,927
我的钥匙
My key.

1220
01:40:46,952 --> 01:40:50,368
只要摧毁了锡安，我就不用再待在这儿了
Once Zion is destroyed, there is no need for me to be here.

1221
01:40:50,393 --> 01:40:52,129
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

1222
01:40:52,414 --> 01:40:54,023
我需要密钥
I need the codes.

1223
01:40:54,148 --> 01:40:56,692
我必须进入锡安……
I have to get inside Zion...

1224
01:40:56,763 --> 01:40:59,329
而你必须告诉我怎么做
...and you have to tell me how.

1225
01:40:59,682 --> 01:41:01,249
你要么告诉我
You're going to tell me...

1226
01:41:01,274 --> 01:41:03,747
要么就去死
...or you're going to die.

1227
01:41:24,366 --> 01:41:28,366
请拿掉身上所有的金属物品，钥匙，零钱
Please remove any metallic items you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1228
01:41:31,361 --> 01:41:32,404
该死！
Holy shit!

1229
01:41:44,386 --> 01:41:46,933
支援，请求支援！
Backup. Send backup.

1230
01:42:11,152 --> 01:42:12,278
不许动！
Freeze!

1231
01:44:27,121 --> 01:44:28,331
你刚才在干什么？
What were you doing?

1232
01:44:29,953 --> 01:44:31,246
他还不知道呢
He doesn't know.

1233
01:44:31,616 --> 01:44:32,962
知道什么？
Know what?

1234
01:45:01,041 --> 01:45:03,394
看来他们是想救他
I think they're trying to save him.

1235
01:45:18,338 --> 01:45:19,992
根本没有勺子
There is no spoon.

1236
01:45:49,730 --> 01:45:51,817
找到并干掉他们！
Find them and destroy them!

1237
01:45:53,538 --> 01:45:55,981
我再重复一遍：我们受到了袭击！
I repeat: we're under attack!

1238
01:46:27,556 --> 01:46:28,683
崔尼蒂
Trinity!

1239
01:46:29,544 --> 01:46:30,449
帮帮我！
Help!

1240
01:46:52,257 --> 01:46:53,403
不过是凡人
Only human.

1241
01:46:54,652 --> 01:46:55,643
有种躲这个
Dodge this.

1242
01:47:08,711 --> 01:47:10,566
-你是怎么做到的？  -做到什么？
-How did you do that?  -Do what?

1243
01:47:10,677 --> 01:47:14,659
你像他们那样躲子弹  我从来没见过谁能这么快
You moved like they do.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1244
01:47:16,151 --> 01:47:17,553
还是不够快
It wasn't fast enough.

1245
01:47:19,767 --> 01:47:21,060
你会开那个吗？
Can you fly that thing?

1246
01:47:22,619 --> 01:47:23,572
现在还不会
Not yet.

1247
01:47:26,866 --> 01:47:27,401
接线员

1248
01:47:27,426 --> 01:47:30,793
坦克  我需要B212直升机的飞行员程序

1249
01:47:31,482 --> 01:47:32,675
要快
Hurry.

1250
01:47:40,711 --> 01:47:41,825
我们走
Let's go.

1251
01:47:57,370 --> 01:47:58,337
No.

1252
01:48:50,081 --> 01:48:52,748
墨菲斯，站起来  起来  快起来
Morpheus, get up. Get up, get up.

1253
01:49:30,860 --> 01:49:31,953
他跳不过来的
He's not going to make it.

1254
01:49:41,545 --> 01:49:42,505
抓住你了
Got you.

1255
01:50:48,826 --> 01:50:49,946
Trinity!

1256
01:51:31,668 --> 01:51:33,035
我就知道
I knew it.

1257
01:51:33,757 --> 01:51:34,848
他是救世主
He's the One.

1258
01:51:50,722 --> 01:51:52,835
你现在相信了吗，崔妮蒂？
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1259
01:51:55,844 --> 01:51:57,012
可是墨菲斯……
Morpheus...

1260
01:51:58,906 --> 01:51:59,990
先知
The Oracle.

1261
01:52:00,996 --> 01:52:03,373
-她告诉我  -她所告诉你的……
-She told me---  -She told you...

1262
01:52:03,841 --> 01:52:05,596
只是你需要知道的
...exactly what you needed to hear.

1263
01:52:05,684 --> 01:52:06,963
仅此而已
That's all.

1264
01:52:07,996 --> 01:52:10,957
尼奥，早晚你会领会到，就像我一样地……
Neo, sooner or later you'll realize, just as I did...

1265
01:52:11,378 --> 01:52:13,671
——知道路在何方……
...there's a difference between knowing the path...

1266
01:52:14,495 --> 01:52:15,855
与真的践行了它，是不一样的
...and walking the path.

1267
01:52:18,667 --> 01:52:20,069
-接线员  -坦克
-Operator.  -Tank.

1268
01:52:20,843 --> 01:52:23,603
-天呐，重新听到你声音真是太棒了，长官  -我们需要出口
-Goddamn. It's good to hear your voice, sir.  -We need an exit.

1269
01:52:23,628 --> 01:52:26,421
准备好了  在地铁站里  State和Balboa站
Got one ready. Subway station, State and Balboa.

1270
01:52:39,411 --> 01:52:42,064
-该死的！  -追踪完毕

1271
01:52:42,089 --> 01:52:45,634
-找到他们的位置了  -哨兵已准备就绪
-We have their position.  -Sentinels are standing by.

1272
01:52:47,377 --> 01:52:48,831
下令攻击吧
Order the strike.

1273
01:52:55,474 --> 01:52:57,354
他们还没出去呢
They're not out yet.

1274
01:53:08,626 --> 01:53:09,961
你先来，墨菲斯
You first, Morpheus.

1275
01:53:30,595 --> 01:53:32,835
尼奥，有件事我想告诉你……
Neo, I want to tell you something...

1276
01:53:36,189 --> 01:53:40,151
但我怕一说出口会发生什么事
...but I'm afraid of what it could mean if I do.

1277
01:53:43,772 --> 01:53:47,086
先知告诉我的事情都成真了
Everything the Oracle told me has come true.

1278
01:53:49,873 --> 01:53:51,416
除了一件事
Everything but this.

1279
01:53:53,156 --> 01:53:54,130
除了什么？
But what?

1280
01:54:19,179 --> 01:54:20,106
尼奥！
Neo!

1281
01:54:20,231 --> 01:54:21,973
-到底出了什么事？  -是特工
-What the hell just happened?  -An agent.

1282
01:54:21,998 --> 01:54:23,940
-你得送我回去  -我做不到的
-You have to send me back.  -I can't.

1283
01:54:26,004 --> 01:54:27,914
安德森先生
Mr. Anderson.

1284
01:54:30,182 --> 01:54:31,708
跑啊，尼奥  快跑
Run, Neo. Run.

1285
01:54:36,994 --> 01:54:38,581
他是在做什么？
What is he doing?

1286
01:54:38,818 --> 01:54:40,208
他开始相信了
He's beginning to believe.

1287
01:55:07,255 --> 01:55:08,568
你没子弹了
You're empty.

1288
01:55:08,942 --> 01:55:10,155
你也一样
So are you.

1289
01:55:43,412 --> 01:55:46,346
我会很享受地看着你死去
I'm going to enjoy watching you die...

1290
01:55:47,569 --> 01:55:48,612
安德森先生
...Mr. Anderson.

1291
01:56:29,508 --> 01:56:31,593
上帝啊，他会活活打死他的
Jesus, he's killing him.

1292
01:57:57,942 --> 01:58:00,069
听见了吗，安德森先生？
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1293
01:58:00,654 --> 01:58:03,657
那儿传来的就是你的宿命
That is the sound of inevitability.

1294
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:09,551
你的丧钟
It is the sound of your death.

1295
01:58:10,565 --> 01:58:13,019
再见了，安德森先生
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1296
01:58:13,044 --> 01:58:14,671
我的名字……

怎么了？  我不知道  我追踪不到他了
What happened?  I don't know. I lost him.

1299
01:58:56,711 --> 01:58:57,754
该死
Oh , shit.

1300
01:59:10,214 --> 01:59:11,634

-还有多久？  -五六分钟吧
-How long?  -Five, maybe six minutes.

1302
01:59:16,681 --> 01:59:18,834
坦克，给EMP充能
Tank, charge the EMP.

1303
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:22,125
-他出来之前我们不能用  -我知道，崔尼蒂  别担心
-We can't use that until he's out.  -I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.

1304
01:59:23,512 --> 01:59:24,549
他能行的
He's gonna make it.

1305
01:59:24,574 --> 01:59:26,451
平底鞋还是高跟鞋?  不，你就……

什么鬼？  那是我的手机！

找到他了！  他正在逃跑

1309
01:59:36,631 --> 01:59:39,172
魔法师先生，带我离开这儿！
Mr. Wizard, get me out of here!

1310
01:59:39,429 --> 01:59:41,541
有个旧出口  Wabash和Lake街的路口
I got an old exit.  Wabash and Lake.

1311
01:59:45,614 --> 01:59:46,615
Oh, shit!

1312
02:00:07,752 --> 02:00:09,754
帮帮我！  我需要一点帮助！
Help!  Need a little help!

1313
02:00:11,494 --> 02:00:12,652
那扇门

他能做到的
He's going to make it.

1320
02:01:45,709 --> 02:01:48,929
（303号房是开场崔尼蒂出现的地方，情节由此形成闭环）
从巷子尽头的逃生梯上去  在303号房

1322
02:02:27,543 --> 02:02:28,476
快点啊，尼奥

1323
02:03:24,714 --> 02:03:25,777
这不可能
It can't be.

1324

检查一下
Check him.

1325

我不再害怕了
I'm not afraid anymore.

1329
02:04:03,212 --> 02:04:04,354
先知告诉我……
The Oracle told me that...

1330
02:04:04,379 --> 02:04:10,458
我会爱上那个男人，我爱上的人会成为救世主
...I'd fall in love with that man, the man that  I loved would be the One.

1331
02:04:13,289 --> 02:04:15,250
所以你看……

你不能……
You can't be...

1334
02:04:22,945 --> 02:04:25,017
因为我爱上的是你

02:04:26,882 --> 02:04:28,592
你能听见吗？
You hear me?

1336
02:04:29,725 --> 02:04:31,394
我爱你
I love you.

1337
02:04:55,365 --> 02:04:56,658
现在，站起来
Now, get up.

1338

1339
02:05:33,104 --> 02:05:33,984
怎么会？

他就是救世主
He is the One.

1341
02:07:03,071 --> 02:07:04,231
尼奥！
Neo!

1342
02:08:00,495 --> 02:08:02,405
（呼叫传输选择：收到）
我知道你就在那里

1343
02:08:02,430 --> 02:08:03,859
（警告：运营商异常）
我能感觉到你

1344
02:08:03,883 --> 02:08:04,631
（追踪程序：运行中）

1345

（追踪程序：运行中）
我知道你害怕我们

1346
02:08:08,737 --> 02:08:10,615
你害怕改变
You're afraid of change.

1347
02:08:10,639 --> 02:08:11,518
（系统崩溃）

1348
02:08:11,542 --> 02:08:13,219
（系统崩溃）
我无法预知未来
I don 't know the future.

1349
02:08:13,421 --> 02:08:16,205
我不是来告诉你 这一切将如何结束的
I didn 't come here to tell you how this is going to end.

1350
02:08:16,335 --> 02:08:19,769
我是来告诉你 一切将如何开始
I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.

1351
02:08:20,216 --> 02:08:21,993
我要挂掉这通电话了
I'm going to hang up this phone.

1352
02:08:22,018 --> 02:08:25,179
然后我将向人们展示你不想告诉他们的一切
And then I'll show these people what you don 't want them to see.

1353
02:08:25,395 --> 02:08:27,458
我将让他们看到一个……
I'm going to show them a world...

1354
02:08:27,483 --> 02:08:29,024
没有你们的世界
...without you.

1355
02:08:29,493 --> 02:08:33,407
一个没有规则和控制，没有界限和尽头的世界
A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries.

1356
02:08:33,432 --> 02:08:36,951
在那里一切皆有可能
A world where anything is possible.

1357
02:08:39,745 --> 02:08:41,296
之后我们将走向何处……
Where we go from there...

1358
02:08:41,321 --> 02:08:43,288
选择权在你手中
...is a choice I leave to you.
