1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,936
This is the Realm of Magic.

2
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:12,854
It's called so because magic
is a natural part of people's life here.

3
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:15,100
They can fly with a broom,

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,372
levitate heavy objects,

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,444
or even make something out of thin air.

6
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:24,156
In this world,
people can use magic at will,

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,612
and magic has become
a regular part in their daily life.

8
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:31,516
People believe that
their magic is a gift given by god.

9
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:35,835
And one's level of magic
can even determine their social status.

10
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:42,809
In this world where dragons
are flying in the sky,

11
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,553
there is a remote forest.

12
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,849
And deep in the forest, there is a man

13
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:51,545
who doesn't fit in
with the rest of the world.

14
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:01,177
There's nothing like cream puff
after some exercise.

15
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:14,528
MASHLE: MAGIC AND MUSCLES

16
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,181
My name is Regro Burnedead.

17
00:02:39,582 --> 00:02:41,726
My son and I live alone

18
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:43,888
in this remote forest.

19
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:47,198
I'm a chic and elegant 75-year-old man.

20
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:49,044
REGRO BURNEDEAD

21
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:53,890
I've done reckless things
when I was young.

22
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:58,402
But when I get to this age,
not much can bother me anymore.

23
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:01,231
If you ask me why,

24
00:03:01,858 --> 00:03:03,911
it's my whole life's experience

25
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:07,591
that taught me how to handle stress.

26
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:10,103
When there's stress…

27
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:14,744
Pop, I'm back.

28
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:17,048
MASHLE BURNEDEAD

29
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:20,662
Why? Why do you have to break the door
every time you come in, Mashle?

30
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:23,067
Because I'm not sure
whether I should push or pull.

31
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:25,351
How many years have you been living here?

32
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:27,214
So I'm trying to find a solution.

33
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:28,895
But you still broke it, didn't you?

34
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,880
Sorry, Pop. I'll fix it.

35
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:37,046
Never mind, since you've apologized.

36
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,055
He's always compliant
after making mistakes.

37
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:45,056
You got it the wrong way!

38
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:46,918
Strange. It won't fit.

39
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:48,143
You got to turn it a little!

40
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,003
Huh? What?

41
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:51,795
It won't work!

42
00:03:51,795 --> 00:03:53,025
I can't stop?

43
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,395
Ah!

44
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:00,436
Sorry, Pop. I'll fix it.

45
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:07,920
Mashle, have you finished
your training today?

46
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:09,796
Of course.

47
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:12,816
Well, Pop.

48
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,024
I've been thinking about one thing.

49
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:16,592
Why do you make me keep working out?

50
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:19,135
You…

51
00:04:19,537 --> 00:04:22,257
You are not like the others.

52
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:26,609
Unlike other people,
you can't use magic at all.

53
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:28,497
So at least…

54
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,335
We'll talk about it some other time.

55
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:35,217
I need to go out now.

56
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:37,201
Guard our house well.

57
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:39,428
Don't break the door again.

58
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,788
Yeah, I already know how to fix it.

59
00:04:42,788 --> 00:04:45,156
Why don't you learn
how to open it in the first place?

60
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,998
Should I push or pull?

61
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:48,758
Pull! You pull!

62
00:04:49,537 --> 00:04:51,745
Anyway, I'm heading out.

63
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:54,785
I know I've told you this
countless times, but still…

64
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:58,433
Don't go to the city when I'm not around.

65
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:00,795
I won't.

66
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:04,289
That's good. Good boy, Mashle.

67
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:06,277
I'll be on my way then.

68
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:07,895
Have a good trip.

69
00:05:17,446 --> 00:05:18,832
Sorry, Pop.

70
00:05:19,396 --> 00:05:21,416
I have to do this.

71
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:33,147
Magic.

72
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:35,003
Magic.

73
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:36,741
More magic.

74
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:41,541
People can still do many things
with a swing of their hands.

75
00:05:48,651 --> 00:05:50,295
I'll take seven of the special puff.

76
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:51,803
Welcome!

77
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:56,304
Heck!

78
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:58,064
I crushed them because I was too excited.

79
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:02,535
But coins don't usually bend
when you squeeze them with bare hands.

80
00:06:03,255 --> 00:06:05,095
Sorry, I'll fix them right now.

81
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,027
Fix them…

82
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:10,377
Sorry about this.

83
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:13,019
Wait.

84
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:16,684
It's… terrifying!

85
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,304
Sorry about the wait, here.

86
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:22,735
Thank you very much.

87
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:27,968
Hey, did you see that?

88
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:29,743
He doesn't have it on his face,
or anywhere else.

89
00:06:29,743 --> 00:06:30,831
No way! He really doesn't!

90
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:32,463
Unbelievable!

91
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:35,295
Sir, are you…

92
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,804
Ah, nothing. Thanks for visiting.

93
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:43,716
This year's Divine Visionary

94
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:47,844
is Rayne Ames, a second year student

95
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,926
at the famous Easton Magic Academy.

96
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,322
He has top performance
at the academy this year.

97
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:57,590
Whoever awarded with this title

98
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:59,747
cannot only be elevated
to the rank of the nobility,

99
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:01,991
-but will also receive a scholarship of one billion Lond.
-Oh, how nice.

100
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:04,129
-Furthermore, they will have internal access
-What a talented guy.

101
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:07,803
-to the highest legal authority,
-Compared with them,

102
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,083
-the Bureau of Magic.
-I can only waste my life

103
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,235
-They are expected to have a bright future
-in a place

104
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:11,899
-in the authorities.
-like this.

105
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:14,999
Please… Please spare me.

106
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:17,927
I just nicked something.

107
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:20,759
Are you kidding me?

108
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,784
It's the scums like you
who give me more work to do.

109
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,716
I'll have to make you regret what you did

110
00:07:29,756 --> 00:07:32,716
so that you won't cause me trouble again.

111
00:07:32,716 --> 00:07:34,684
D-Don't! Please!

112
00:07:39,388 --> 00:07:41,500
What? I'm busy.

113
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:46,045
What? There's an unmarked brat
on the street?

114
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:50,380
I wonder why those folks are so riled up.

115
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:55,491
Don't go to the city when I'm not around.

116
00:07:56,473 --> 00:07:57,977
Sorry, Pop.

117
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:00,963
But I didn't come here in vain.

118
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:03,899
After all, I got the goblin cream puffs.

119
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:08,117
Yummy. Yummy. Yum…

120
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:12,763
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:14,347
Hey!

122
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:15,864
Look what you've done!

123
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,074
I'm an officer on duty here!

124
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:19,483
VODKA 90% ABV
I'm a magic police officer here

125
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:21,883
to protect you ordinary people!

126
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,363
Don't you have any gratitude?

127
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:28,243
I only got pennies
every month for the work I do!

128
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,835
How about I take my stress out
on you, kid?

129
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,795
Do you want a cream puff?

130
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,071
You sound pretty miserable.

131
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:40,953
Are you pitying me?
With a cream puff that's already chewed?

132
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:44,631
What do you mean by giving me
a cream puff that's half eaten?

133
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:47,943
Do you want an indirect kiss?
Do you fancy me?

134
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:50,011
Are you looking for trouble with me?

135
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:52,123
Do you know I represent the authorities?

136
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,711
And how are you going to
pay for my uniform?

137
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,835
What?

138
00:09:02,768 --> 00:09:06,036
I'm very sorry. I'll wash your clothes
and return them to you.

139
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:09,371
I don't even have any clothes now!

140
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:10,989
It's all your fault!

141
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:13,531
What did you do to me? Huh?

142
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:14,895
What is it, Terry?

143
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:16,689
Mr. Brad, this guy…

144
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:19,765
Don't yell for such petty things.

145
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:22,908
But why are you half naked?

146
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,932
BRAD COLEMAN

147
00:09:25,337 --> 00:09:27,641
No! It's this brat who…

148
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:29,851
It's him?

149
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:33,219
The unmarked brat from the report?

150
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:38,496
But how can he stuff himself
with cream puff at a time like this?

151
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:41,359
Hey, you over there!

152
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,047
Please excuse my boy!

153
00:09:53,322 --> 00:09:55,311
This will be a bit of a hassle.

154
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,762
But now is my chance to hit something big.

155
00:10:02,193 --> 00:10:03,633
Go after them!

156
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:14,098
Idiot!

157
00:10:14,395 --> 00:10:16,347
I've told you not to go into the city.

158
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:17,627
How many times have I said that?

159
00:10:18,174 --> 00:10:21,298
I'm really sorry. It won't happen again.

160
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:26,877
He looks upset
and he's acknowledged his mistakes.

161
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:29,218
I can't stay mad at him.

162
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:32,027
Well then,

163
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,893
as a punishment,

164
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:38,063
you'll repeat
this morning's training session.

165
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:39,067
Okay.

166
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:42,040
This cream puff is for you, Pop.

167
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:44,123
Thank you.

168
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,747
Please.

169
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,575
Thanks, Pop.

170
00:10:54,277 --> 00:10:55,832
What a compliant kid.

171
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:59,188
Aren't kids his age
supposed to be more impulsive,

172
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:00,436
have arguments and fights with parents,

173
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:04,430
and gradually grow a stronger bond
with their parents?

174
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,795
But he's so obedient.

175
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:08,322
I feel like I'm getting off too easy.

176
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:14,043
He's reached the age
at which he'd want to leave home?

177
00:11:14,931 --> 00:11:17,758
For all this time, I stay away from people

178
00:11:17,758 --> 00:11:20,162
and live a secluded life
in the forest for Mashle.

179
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:23,447
But now, the magic police

180
00:11:23,547 --> 00:11:26,299
have learned his existence.

181
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,625
I must find a way…

182
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:35,700
That is…

183
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:51,848
Hey, old man. Where is that brat?

184
00:11:53,102 --> 00:11:55,147
I got trouble.

185
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,482
The training only takes five minutes
if I put my heart into it.

186
00:12:12,015 --> 00:12:14,511
Okay, time to get back
for more cream puffs.

187
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:19,632
Cream as the cream in cream puff.

188
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,136
Puff as the puff in cream puff.

189
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:26,463
Cream puff as the cream puff in…

190
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:30,227
Should I push or pull?

191
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:32,506
Whatever.

192
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:36,010
Old man, you know what's up with that brat
and you hid him here, right?

193
00:12:36,618 --> 00:12:38,797
Do you know what makes the magic

194
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,418
in our world flourishing?

195
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:44,561
It's because we have cleaned
the lowly blood

196
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:47,036
that has no magic power from our society.

197
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:51,442
That's a necessary sacrifice
to keep our society running.

198
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,165
Let me be more specific.

199
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,920
People who can't use magic

200
00:12:57,408 --> 00:13:00,144
don't deserve to survive.

201
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:03,658
No, I should say
they should never have been born.

202
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,231
Spit it out! Where is he?

203
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,583
I have no idea what you are talking about.

204
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:17,349
Hiding unmarked people

205
00:13:17,353 --> 00:13:19,465
is a serious crime, old man.

206
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,022
Give him to me now.

207
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:25,307
I refuse.

208
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:31,704
To be honest, if you cooperate
and give that brat to me,

209
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:34,904
I might let you off the hook.

210
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,734
I will… I'll never tell.

211
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,325
Why can't you do something
as simple as that?

212
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,293
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:47,813
Your magic power is weak
and you are so stupid.

214
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:49,583
We don't need a useless child like you

215
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,079
in our family.

216
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,173
I'm sorry.

217
00:13:54,557 --> 00:13:57,533
Hey! You screwed up something so simple.

218
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:58,884
You are so useless!

219
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:00,701
I… I'm sorry!

220
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:02,223
I can hardly find someone worse than you.

221
00:14:02,223 --> 00:14:05,103
I was never a bright kid
when I was little.

222
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:08,753
As I grew older, I encountered
failure after failure.

223
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:12,103
You failed again! You are fired!

224
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:14,803
How can you even stand to be alive?

225
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:17,251
I would've killed myself if I were you.

226
00:14:24,423 --> 00:14:27,240
I was never needed by anyone.

227
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:30,495
And I've thought about taking my own life.

228
00:14:35,902 --> 00:14:38,800
I should just…

229
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,478
This child has no mark.

230
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:56,011
Did they abandon you
because you have no mark?

231
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:00,331
We share the same fate.

232
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:07,287
At that moment,

233
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:11,149
I felt needed
for the first time in my life.

234
00:15:12,748 --> 00:15:14,831
I made a promise then,

235
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:19,444
that even though
we are not biologically related,

236
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:23,559
even though the whole world rejects us,

237
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:27,351
I would still be his father.

238
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:30,567
Old man! Tell me where he is now!

239
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,631
Run, Mashle!

240
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,054
You old fool!

241
00:15:34,054 --> 00:15:38,088
Hey! That means
he must be somewhere close! Find him!

242
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:39,195
Yes!

243
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:40,757
Run, Mashle!

244
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:42,965
Damn it! You old fool!

245
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,619
Please let my voice reach him.

246
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:49,040
Shut up, you!

247
00:15:49,957 --> 00:15:53,218
You have to live
even if you are all alone in this world.

248
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,063
For me, you are the only…

249
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,036
Run! Run for your life! Mashle!

250
00:16:02,323 --> 00:16:04,246
You stubborn old thing!

251
00:16:05,154 --> 00:16:07,017
You'll regret this.

252
00:16:31,644 --> 00:16:34,246
You brat! How dare you…

253
00:16:36,302 --> 00:16:37,750
Two uniforms in the same day.

254
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:49,366
Why? Why didn't you run away, Mashle?

255
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,552
Because you are my family.

256
00:16:52,082 --> 00:16:54,050
My only family.

257
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:58,514
Pop, please forgive my stubbornness.

258
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,128
But now…

259
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:06,068
Go to hell, all of you.

260
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,756
This is interesting.

261
00:17:10,756 --> 00:17:12,367
You can't even use magic.

262
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,682
How are you going to fight me?

263
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:17,667
Stupid brat. Mr. Brad used to work

264
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:20,342
in the Bureau of Magic's Security Force.

265
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:23,990
Even the regular Mages there
are no match for him.

266
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,938
It's a joke that a low-born brat
without any magic power

267
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:29,754
thinks he has a chance against Mr. Brad.

268
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:32,556
I can finish you within three second.

269
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:38,487
That's the magic he used
to drive off the dragons

270
00:17:38,487 --> 00:17:40,812
back in his days in the Security Force!

271
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:43,671
I never thought
I'd have the honor to witness it!

272
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:49,500
Eat this! Nalcompas!

273
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,627
Mashle!

274
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,935
Mashle!

275
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:10,013
That… That brat deflected Nalcompas

276
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:14,256
with a single slap of hand?

277
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:17,760
Is it possible to
stop magic attacks with a hand?

278
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,216
I've driven off dragons with that magic.

279
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:23,803
It's impossible!

280
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:27,552
Not bad, brat!

281
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:29,904
Let's see what you can do with this!

282
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,063
The magic power is pouring out!

283
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:34,090
Does he want to destroy this whole place?

284
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:37,275
Wait, Mr. Brad! You can't!

285
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:39,756
Nalcompas Diagorus!

286
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:50,766
Damn it!

287
00:18:52,426 --> 00:18:53,482
This guy…

288
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:55,199
He reduced its momentum with his knees!

289
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:57,486
How can he be so flexible?

290
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,275
Well then, take this!

291
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:03,473
He's even juggling it now!

292
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:07,169
And he's dribbling it like a ball!

293
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:11,345
He's making a fool of me!

294
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:16,351
Pop, can I borrow your wand?

295
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:18,217
What's he going to do?

296
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:20,665
Does he know magic?

297
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:23,631
It doesn't matter.

298
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,643
Some everyday magic

299
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,421
won't lay a scratch on me.

300
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,170
This is my first time

301
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:53,309
seeing someone use a wand like that.

302
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:59,464
I'll kill you if you hurt my family again.

303
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:03,213
I did make him
exercise for self-defense purposes,

304
00:20:03,213 --> 00:20:05,153
but he could be that powerful?

305
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:08,131
But no matter what, it's all over now.

306
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:11,731
Even if we can drive off these people now,
only more will…

307
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,155
Interesting. Let's make a deal,
mushroom head.

308
00:20:17,772 --> 00:20:19,725
If you do what I ask,

309
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:21,932
I'll let you two slide.

310
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:23,419
A deal?

311
00:20:23,741 --> 00:20:25,795
In this country,

312
00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:29,628
they pick the best student every year
to be worshipped as the one chosen by god.

313
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:31,299
And they are called Divine Visionaries.

314
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:35,919
I want you to enroll in the magic academy
and become a Divine Visionary.

315
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:38,200
Simple, isn't it?

316
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,088
If you get selected,
it means you are accepted by god.

317
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:43,975
And the society will accept you too.

318
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:48,130
I just want the money
and the power that comes with this title.

319
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,261
I'll help you on your way there,
of course.

320
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,152
Don't listen to him, Mashle!

321
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:54,936
He was our enemy just a minute ago!

322
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:58,200
You can be skeptical or whatever.

323
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,800
But if you refuse,
I'll keep hunting you for all your life.

324
00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:06,373
And that means the whole country
will be hunting you.

325
00:21:06,937 --> 00:21:08,675
You are a tough one, brat.

326
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:11,137
But what about your old man?

327
00:21:11,877 --> 00:21:14,525
You'll be living in fear
every day in your life.

328
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:16,695
You can't even set foot outside the house.

329
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:19,095
Make your choice.

330
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:21,867
Do you want to be hunted
for the rest of your life?

331
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:25,267
Or do you want to give it all
to change your fate?

332
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:30,007
It's a deal.

333
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:32,914
Are you serious? It's a magic academy!

334
00:21:32,914 --> 00:21:34,747
It's okay, Pop.

335
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:36,841
My willpower is twice
as strong as that of others.

336
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:39,149
It's not about willpower!

337
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:42,881
Besides, I want to
live a peaceful life with you.

338
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:47,265
You are such a good kid.

339
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:51,348
I just want to
live in peace with my family.

340
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,716
If this world doesn't even allow
something like that,

341
00:22:02,963 --> 00:22:05,528
then I'll have to crush it

342
00:22:06,153 --> 00:22:07,497
with my fist.

343
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:45,216
