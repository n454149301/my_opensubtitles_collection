1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,500
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Huh? What the hell?</i></font>

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,990
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Why did a powered suit from 
Yggdrasil suddenly appear?</i></font>

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,640
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Could it be a player?</i></font>

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,740
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The Death Knight and Death Warrior 
were destroyed so easily...</font>

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,520
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Mm. Just as expected.</font>

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I see. So that's why...</font>

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,760
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Huh? Cocytus?!</i></font>

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,760
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes! Yes! Yes! I understand now, too!</font>

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,390
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Lord Ains was expecting the 
one in red armor to appear!</font>

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,480
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He chose to send fewer soldiers in order 
to lure the enemy out into the open!</font>

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,450
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Excellent deduction from the 
two of you, as expected!</font>

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,280
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Y-Yeah.</font>

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,680
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Hey, who is that guy?</font>

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He's from Drop of Red, one of the 
three adamantite teams in the Kingdom.</font>

15
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,160
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's reported that his team normally works 
in the northern region of the Kingdom.</font>

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">S-So that's why Lord Ains set 
a trap in this northern city!</font>

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,740
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So, he's a fish that took the bait...</font>

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,550
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Exactly.</font>

19
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,320
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Now that you've achieved your original goal,</font>

20
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,310
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">we should send stronger forces to 
that town and raze it to the ground.</font>

21
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,850
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes, that sounds good...</font>

22
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,370
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">N-No, I was thinking of 
changing the plans a bit</font>

23
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,950
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and bringing the royal capital 
to ruin immediately.</font>

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,200
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">If that is what you wish, we will simply obey.</font>

25
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,150
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes.</font>

26
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,850
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>This way, I'll be able to give the people
 in that town a chance to escape.</i></font>

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Good! We will cease hiding our movements
 and advance on the royal capital!</font>

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,470
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We will annihilate every city 
within our reach along the way.</font>

29
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,490
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Teach them the foolishness 
of resisting Nazarick!</font>

30
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,310
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes!</font>

31
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,110
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Your Highness, 
Princess Renner is here to see you.</font>

32
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,570
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'll speak with her during dinner.</font>

33
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,010
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">She said that if she can't 
speak with you immediately,</font>

34
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,450
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">she'll begin yelling lies mixed with truth...</font>

35
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,080
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I understand. Let her in.</font>

36
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,550
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But have the other two 
with her stand outside.</font>

37
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,710
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I understand.</font>

38
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,470
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What is it?</font>

39
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,220
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Is Father still alive?</font>

40
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,230
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Hey, now. Do you think I'd kill him?</font>

41
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,770
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">At a time like this?</font>

42
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Father is not well right now.</font>

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,860
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'm having him rest.</font>

44
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,770
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Brother is able to detain Father even 
without Marquis Raeven's soldiers...</font>

45
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,890
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That means that the head of the military</font>

46
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and the head of internal 
affairs have taken your side.</font>

47
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Father planned to negotiate until the end,</font>

48
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,460
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">in order to minimize our losses.</font>

49
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I understand his feelings, but...</font>

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,320
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">There had been no word of</font>

51
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">the Sorcerer Kingdom invading 
since the declaration of war.</font>

52
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,760
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But, in reality, his army has been 
heading north this whole time.</font>

53
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He took over the northern border 
near the Council State</font>

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,390
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">in order to prevent them 
from sending support troops.</font>

55
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,020
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That's right.</font>

56
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,400
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The invaded cities were completely destroyed 
and all the people were massacred.</font>

57
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,400
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">My sister...</font>

58
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Please enlighten me with your brilliant mind.</font>

59
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">How have the Sorcerer Kingdom's 
forces gone unnoticed until now?</font>

60
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,160
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You've realized it yourself, haven't you?</font>

61
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,480
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's the work of the people 
in our own kingdom.</font>

62
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,300
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But the only person who can keep 
this a secret so thoroughly...</font>

63
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,050
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">...is Marquis Raeven.</font>

64
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,220
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">No way! Impossible.</font>

65
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,720
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">This is Marquis Raeven's domain.</font>

66
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,480
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That man loves his son quite dearly.</font>

67
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Wouldn't he do it if his 
son were taken hostage?</font>

68
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,610
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You think they're threatening him that way?</font>

69
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,860
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I believe that he's decided that 
the royal family has no future.</font>

70
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,620
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What action would you take 
in a situation like this?</font>

71
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,160
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">If things continue according 
to the movements on this map,</font>

72
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">there will be a decisive battle 
at the royal capital next.</font>

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes.</font>

74
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,750
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Do you think we can win?</font>

75
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's not a matter of winning or losing. 
We have to do it.</font>

76
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,120
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The Sorcerer Kingdom is burning down all the 
cities and murdering all who live in them.</font>

77
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,920
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We can only survive by 
gathering all the soldiers</font>

78
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,390
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and risking everything on 
the slim chance of victory.</font>

79
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,410
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'll ask the people, as well.</font>

80
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,770
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We'll advertise the cruelty of the 
Sorcerer Kingdom and call them to arms.</font>

81
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,780
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Brother, you've truly become a king.</font>

82
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,410
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Your way of thinking is correct.</font>

83
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,160
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'm completely useless in battle,</font>

84
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,860
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">but a member of the royal family should 
stand on the front lines to lead the troops.</font>

85
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,760
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Father should take care of the rest.</font>

86
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,170
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You can escape at any time.</font>

87
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,470
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I understand. 
I'll do so when the time comes.</font>

88
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,600
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What're you gonna do?</font>

89
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,220
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'm joining! 
Just you wait, Sorcerer King!</font>

90
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,560
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Hey, everyone...</font>

91
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,020
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Only one person needs to go to 
see the contents of the request.</font>

92
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,480
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Why don't you guys go and get a drink?</font>

93
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Lakyus, is there a reason 
we can't go with you?</font>

94
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,180
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">O-O-Of course not!</font>

95
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The Drop of Red are coming for 
this request, aren't they?</font>

96
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,500
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Isn't their leader, Mr. Azuth, your relative?</font>

97
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,120
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You guys probably have a lot to 
catch up on, right? I get you.</font>

98
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So, you understand?! Then...</font>

99
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That's the mystery.</font>

100
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,560
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So strange.</font>

101
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,130
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Huh?</font>

102
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:30,130
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What kind of request requires both 
the Drop of Red and Blue Rose?</font>

103
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,380
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's suspicious.</font>

104
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,010
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Maybe it's a trap.</font>

105
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,010
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes. We shouldn't act separately.</font>

106
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,090
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">And we want to meet such a famous hero.</font>

107
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,400
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He's a relative, so it wouldn't 
hurt to meet him at least once.</font>

108
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,860
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">This is the meeting place.</font>

109
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,250
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Too suspicious.</font>

110
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,100
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Someone is definitely planning something.</font>

111
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,030
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Come on in.</font>

112
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,580
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Um, everyone...</font>

113
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,240
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Let me be honest.</font>

114
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,420
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">My uncle's the type of person 
that makes most people grimace.</font>

115
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,720
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Hey, Lakyu! Long time no see!</font>

116
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,480
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Uncle... Can't you dress a little 
more appropriately for this meeting?</font>

117
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,050
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Well, now. At least we're not 
having a meeting in bed.</font>

118
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,650
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Does it really matter?</font>

119
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,860
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It matters!</font>

120
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,090
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Is that so?</font>

121
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,950
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Aw, stop!</font>

122
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,790
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">And I heard he was a hero...</font>

123
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,780
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Leave, women.</font>

124
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,250
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Who's this kid?</font>

125
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,040
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A brat who doesn't even show her face 
shouldn't act so high and mighty!</font>

126
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,950
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Charm Person.</font>

127
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,360
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You're in the way. Leave.</font>

128
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,920
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Oh, yes.</font>

129
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,420
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Charm Person.</font>

130
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,140
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Go.</font>

131
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,700
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I understand.</font>

132
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,030
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Evileye.</font>

133
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,940
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Good job!</font>

134
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,430
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Boss.</font>

135
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,440
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You're on time.</font>

136
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,640
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Hey, hey, hey...</font>

137
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,590
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You're the last ones here and you're 
giving off such dangerous vibes.</font>

138
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,840
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You're pretty cocky for 
bringing whores, old man.</font>

139
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,840
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Hah. You're the ones who held 
a meeting in a place like this.</font>

140
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,720
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I just wanted to harass you guys a bit.</font>

141
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,990
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Now, now.</font>

142
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,430
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I would appreciate it if 
everyone settled down.</font>

143
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,350
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Well, Qua's the leader this time, 
so I guess I'll listen...</font>

144
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,600
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Let me get straight to the point.</font>

145
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,990
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Lord Azuth Aindra and the other 
absent members from the Drop of Red...</font>

146
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,260
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">As well as all the members from Blue Rose...</font>

147
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,820
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We are here to scout you today.</font>

148
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,500
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Which country are you guys from?</font>

149
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,750
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Who cares?</font>

150
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,160
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What?</font>

151
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,920
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">No way!</font>

152
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,750
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Please be at ease.</font>

153
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,390
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">If we really planned to kill all of you,</font>

154
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,510
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">we wouldn't be wasting 
time introducing ourselves.</font>

155
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,220
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Are you people from the Theocracy?</font>

156
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,600
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The Theocracy?!</font>

157
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,600
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The Theocracy's elite heroic unit.</font>

158
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,140
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The Black Scripture, was it?</font>

159
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,930
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I heard one of you deviated 
from the heroic path, though.</font>

160
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,840
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It seems like you know a lot.</font>

161
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:47,820
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But there are people here who are as 
strong as me, maybe even stronger.</font>

162
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,910
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Evileye of the Blue Rose. 
You'd be a bit troublesome.</font>

163
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Hmph.</font>

164
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,650
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Hey.</font>

165
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,910
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Theocracy's secret unit.</font>

166
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,680
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Want to work with us to fight 
against the Sorcerer King?</font>

167
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I see.</font>

168
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,440
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I understand your thoughts, Lord Azuth.</font>

169
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,060
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">And what's the answer from the Blue Rose?</font>

170
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,770
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We won't force you by any means.</font>

171
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:20,840
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We want you to truly become our allies 
and help secure the future of mankind.</font>

172
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,560
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I refuse. How about...</font>

173
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,080
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Don't just speak for yourself.</font>

174
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,170
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We all agree with Leader's decision.</font>

175
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,080
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yeah.</font>

176
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,500
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I see.</font>

177
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,780
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Looks like it'd be pointless
 to try to convince you.</font>

178
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,010
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We hope everyone is able to bring 
retribution upon the Sorcerer King.</font>

179
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,470
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So...</font>

180
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,210
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What are you going to do, Uncle?</font>

181
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,810
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'll wait here for the arrival 
of the Sorcerer King.</font>

182
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,340
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He'll definitely make his way here.</font>

183
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,060
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You guys won't even be able to 
get your swords close to him.</font>

184
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,210
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Run.</font>

185
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,190
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Even so, we can't leave the 
royal capital behind.</font>

186
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,600
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">If you're asking me to join you, I refuse.</font>

187
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,700
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'll be moving on my own.</font>

188
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,640
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Do you think you'll be able to do anything?</font>

189
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,840
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">There's no way I can defeat him.</font>

190
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,020
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But if I'm alone,</font>

191
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,460
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I should be able to escape, even if the 
Sorcerer King surrounds the entire capital.</font>

192
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,220
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Welp, I'm going to unload 
a bit in the other room.</font>

193
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,820
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Sorry for the wait, kittens.</font>

194
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,820
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Jeez! You took forever!</font>

195
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,570
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Your Highness.</font>

196
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,730
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I know.</font>

197
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:49,370
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Lord Ains, a representative is 
approaching from the human army.</font>

198
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I am the crown prince of the Re-Estize Kingdom, 
Zanac Valleon Igana Ryle Vaiself!</font>

199
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,560
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I would like to speak with the Sorcerer King!</font>

200
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,140
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What do you wish to do, Lord Ains?</font>

201
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,850
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I feel there's no need to listen, unless it's 
a messenger announcing the start of battle...</font>

202
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:14,480
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">If he refuses to converse with an opponent, 
others may think him close-minded.</font>

203
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,350
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Who cares about a rumor when 
no one is left to spread it?</font>

204
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,490
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Albedo. Have you forgotten?</font>

205
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,340
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">There may be someone watching from 
afar who can speak ill of us.</font>

206
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,280
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">My apologies.</font>

207
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,280
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes. Then, I will go.</font>

208
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,520
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Lord Ains, bring guards with you.</font>

209
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,840
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A royal came to me alone.</font>

210
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,770
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It is only right that I return the favor.</font>

211
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I am glad to meet you, Sorcerer King.</font>

212
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,980
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I am Zanac Valleon Igana Ryle Vaiself.</font>

213
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,760
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I am glad to meet you, as well.</font>

214
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,680
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I am the Sorcerer King, Ains Ooal Gown.</font>

215
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,190
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Will water suffice?</font>

216
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,480
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes. Thank you very much, Your Majesty.</font>

217
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,480
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I appreciate your hospitality.</font>

218
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,900
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Now, the preparations for 
our talk are complete.</font>

219
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,100
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What did you wish to speak about?</font>

220
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,620
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Shall I discuss why 
our invasion is just?</font>

221
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,130
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Your Majesty, 
there's something I'd like to ask.</font>

222
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,750
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Why are you doing something this cruel?</font>

223
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,740
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Why won't you accept our plea of surrender?</font>

224
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,670
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Because there is no merit to it.</font>

225
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,010
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Merit?</font>

226
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,170
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We will sacrifice your kingdom 
to show the world that</font>

227
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:42,270
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">it is foolish to oppose 
the Sorcerer Kingdom.</font>

228
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:47,030
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">To that end, we will enter your royal 
capital after decimating your forces</font>

229
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,040
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and turn everything into 
a mountain of rubble.</font>

230
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,020
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We'll leave everything like that for 
hundreds or even thousands of years...</font>

231
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">In this way, stories about the folly 
of going against the Sorcerer Kingdom</font>

232
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,860
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">will be passed down for all eternity.</font>

233
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,130
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Why have you chosen to do so?</font>

234
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What?</font>

235
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">There are other ways</font>

236
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,570
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">to have Your Majesty's prestige 
known throughout the world.</font>

237
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,980
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Why are your actions so close-minded?</font>

238
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,820
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Close-minded, huh?</font>

239
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,420
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What is your goal?</font>

240
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,760
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">My goal?</font>

241
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,450
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>My comrades from Yggdrasil may 
exist somewhere in this world.</i></font>

242
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,060
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>That's what I had hoped...</i></font>

243
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,120
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">My goal...</font>

244
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,930
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It seems simple and complicated 
at the same time.</font>

245
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,350
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">My goal...</font>

246
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">There's only one thing I'm searching for...</font>

247
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Happiness.</font>

248
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,890
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Happiness?</font>

249
00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:01,270
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">In the end, isn't the ultimate 
goal of all creatures happiness?</font>

250
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,770
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So, you're saying it's fine to take away the 
happiness of others for the sake of your own?</font>

251
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,520
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Isn't that obvious?</font>

252
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,690
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">If I can bring happiness 
to the ones I treasure,</font>

253
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,280
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I don't care about what 
happens to anyone else.</font>

254
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,600
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">If your people could only achieve happiness</font>

255
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,410
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">by making the people of another 
country suffer, what would you do?</font>

256
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,670
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Would you tell your people 
to give up on that happiness?</font>

257
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,540
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That logic is too extreme!</font>

258
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,250
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Excuse me, Your Majesty.</font>

259
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,270
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">No, I don't mind.</font>

260
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,950
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Are you telling me that</font>

261
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,880
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">someone of Your Majesty's intelligence and 
power had no other way to move forward?</font>

262
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,860
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">There may be other ways.</font>

263
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,030
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">However, it's better to grab a hold of 
the chance to obtain such happiness</font>

264
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,150
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">if the opportunity to do 
so is easily available.</font>

265
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,410
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">They say, "The goddess of 
fortune is bald behind."</font>

266
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,470
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What a strange goddess.</font>

267
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,890
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Oh, pardon me.</font>

268
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:03,100
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'm not belittling the gods 
you believe in or anything.</font>

269
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,540
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Please forgive me.</font>

270
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,640
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I don't mind.</font>

271
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I don't particularly believe in them.</font>

272
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,720
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So, that's how it is.</font>

273
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,920
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I will have you suffer for the happiness 
of the people I must protect.</font>

274
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,430
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Does my answer satisfy you?</font>

275
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,770
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Well, they say it is the 
duty of those at the top</font>

276
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:28,810
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">to pursue benefits for their country 
and bring happiness to their people.</font>

277
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,890
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I understand your reason for 
refusing our surrender.</font>

278
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,820
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It seems there is nothing else I can do.</font>

279
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,470
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Now, I guess it's my turn to question you.</font>

280
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,200
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That's right.</font>

281
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,710
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Who currently holds the sword 
that Gazef Stronoff wielded?</font>

282
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,480
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The armor you're wearing was 
also previously worn by him.</font>

283
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,080
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes.</font>

284
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:54,210
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A man named Brain Unglaus is currently 
in possession of that sword.</font>

285
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,280
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Brain Unglaus...</font>

286
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,470
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Oh, is that man currently here?</font>

287
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,350
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">No, he should be in the royal palace.</font>

288
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,550
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I see.</font>

289
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,980
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Then, it seems it doesn't matter what 
spells I use to decimate your forces.</font>

290
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,470
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We don't plan to lose,</font>

291
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,490
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">but I hope you use magic that will 
kill us without much suffering.</font>

292
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,030
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Well...</font>

293
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,440
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We've now become acquainted with one another.</font>

294
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,620
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'll make sure to kill 
you as gently as I can.</font>

295
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,930
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I appreciate that.</font>

296
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,620
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The drink was delicious, Your Majesty.</font>

297
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,140
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">May I ask you one last thing?</font>

298
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,520
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Did you or perhaps one of your 
subordinates kill my elder brother?</font>

299
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,560
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Your brother?</font>

300
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,310
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The deed was probably done by one of mine.</font>

301
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,020
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I see. So he's dead, after all.</font>

302
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,440
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Thank you for letting me know, Your Majesty.</font>

303
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,950
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'll take my leave.</font>

304
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,510
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A dauntless man.</font>

305
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,510
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That must be what true royalty is like.</font>

306
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,200
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">My goal...</font>

307
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,730
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">There's only one thing I'm searching for...</font>

308
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,840
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Happiness.</font>

309
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,820
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Perhaps I was never fit to be a king.</i></font>

310
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,300
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>I just wanted to make this 
kingdom into a respectable one.</i></font>

311
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,360
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Your Highness!</font>

312
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,750
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You're safe!</font>

313
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,360
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What did the Sorcerer King say?!</font>

314
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,320
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The Sorcerer King plans to 
massacre everyone in the kingdom.</font>

315
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,870
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">There was no opportunity for negotiation.</font>

316
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,070
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Welcome back.</font>

317
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,750
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It sounds like the talk didn't go well.</font>

318
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">In other words, the talk went as expected.</font>

319
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,730
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I see.</font>

320
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,840
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So, what kind of evil monster 
was the Sorcerer King?</font>

321
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,120
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He was surprisingly human.</font>

322
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,640
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What?</font>

323
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,840
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Well, he was definitely 
a monster on the outside.</font>

324
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,210
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But, well, he was the same as 
any other human on the inside.</font>

325
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,530
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So what is the plan of attack?</font>

326
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,150
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">There's no plan.</font>

327
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,020
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We lost many of our commanders 
and knights in the last battle.</font>

328
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,760
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Truthfully speaking,</font>

329
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,160
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I didn't like Stronoff, so I never thought 
I would miss him at a time like this...</font>

330
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,070
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You people are...</font>

331
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,170
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">King Zanac!</font>

332
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,920
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Stand down! This is His Highness's tent!</font>

333
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,080
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>A rebellion at this point and time?</i></font>

334
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,440
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>No, this is just the result of 
their desperate attempt to live...</i></font>

335
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,800
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You lowly people! Stand down!</font>

336
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,480
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Stop, Representative.</font>

337
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,440
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">For what reason did you enter my tent?</font>

338
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,810
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Your Highness, please surrender.</font>

339
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,590
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's impossible.</font>

340
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,950
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We can only survive if we 
defeat the Sorcerer King.</font>

341
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,280
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We can't win!</font>

342
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,820
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He has an army of undead!</font>

343
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,120
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That may be the case for you, Your Highness.</font>

344
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,260
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But we'll exchange your life for our own!</font>

345
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,830
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We will go and pledge our 
allegiance to the Sorcerer King!</font>

346
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,340
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Your Highness, please obey us quietly.</font>

347
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:30,350
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">As a member of the royal family, 
I have the resolve to fight to the end.</font>

348
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,060
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Come, if you don't fear losing your life!</font>

349
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,690
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What's wrong?!</font>

350
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,220
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Come and take this neck if you can!</font>

351
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,050
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Lord Ains.</font>

352
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,320
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What is it, Albedo?</font>

353
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,200
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Some nobles from the Kingdom 
wish to see the Sorcerer King.</font>

354
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,490
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Bring them here.</font>

355
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:03,990
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We are in awe of Your Majesty and 
wish to bow down at your feet.</font>

356
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,220
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Please accept this, Your Majesty.</font>

357
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,480
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Bury him with respect.</font>

358
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,490
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So, what happened to the 
armor this man was wearing?</font>

359
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,850
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What's wrong? 
You can't answer Lord Ains' question?</font>

360
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,180
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">N-No! Well, about that...</font>

361
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,120
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I believe it's with the 
prince's corpse in his tent.</font>

362
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I see. I understand.</font>

363
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,380
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You all did well.</font>

364
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,470
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I shall give you a reward 
comparable to your efforts.</font>

365
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,700
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What do you want?</font>

366
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,940
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Please spare me and my family!</font>

367
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,390
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Sorcerer King! 
I pledge my complete allegiance to you!</font>

368
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,150
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}I do, as well, Your Majesty!</font>

369
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,930
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Please show mercy on us!</font>

370
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:55,930
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}Me, as well!</font>

371
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,630
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I understand. I understand.</font>

372
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,960
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Then, I will spare you and your families.</font>

373
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,650
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Thank you very much!</font>

374
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:06,780
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Albedo, send them to Neuronist.</font>

375
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,650
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Understood.</font>

376
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,060
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Thank you!</font>

377
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,160
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Long live His Majesty, the Sorcerer King!</font>

378
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,020
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Aura.</font>

379
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,410
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes, Lord Ains.</font>

380
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:21,610
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Make sure to tell Neuronist not to 
kill them unless they beg for death.</font>

381
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,670
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I understand, Lord Ains!</font>

382
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,720
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Even if they beg for death, 
don't kill them too quickly.</font>

383
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,500
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes!</font>

384
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,070
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I've lost interest.</font>

385
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,230
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Cocytus will be the commander 
and Mare the vice-commander.</font>

386
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,230
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes.</font>

387
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,230
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yes!</font>

388
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:45,050
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I allow the two of you to 
freely use your strength...</font>

389
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,540
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So don't let a single one of them survive.</font>
