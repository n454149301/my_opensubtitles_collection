Why risk it all?

356
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,320
You could have a statue of yourself
in the town square, Governor.

357
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,240
Killing Michonne

358
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,720
is sort of beneath you, don't you think?

359
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,320
You could save your son.

360
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,440
Save your daughter.

361
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,360
Everyone you know.

362
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,240
It's your choice.

363
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,600
If I give you Michonne,

364
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,360
how do I know you'll keep your word?

365
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,640
That you'll stop?

366
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,440
You can have everything you want.

367
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,360
I told you, I don't care about you.

368
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,840
You think about it.

369
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,960
Two days.

370
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,000
I'll be here at noon.

371
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,120
(MOTORBIKE STARTS)

372
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,480
(VEHICLE ENGINE STARTS)

373
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,880
(SNARLING)

374
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,520
(MUSIC PLAYING)

375
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,080
Let's get inside.

376
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,800
Position gunmen
all around that feed store.

377
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,920
The minute you see Michonne,
you open fire.

378
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,080
Kill the others, but you keep her alive.

379
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,160
What about the deal?

380
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,560
Well, they'll bring Rick, Merle's brother,
maybe Glenn, Merle himself.

381
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,360
We can take care of the whole crew.

382
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,640
It's the best way to avoid a slaughter.

383
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,640
That is a slaughter.

384
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,520
Not at our end.

385
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,400
We're gonna have to eliminate
Rick sooner or later.

386
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,080
No way we can all live side by side.

387
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,560
Thanks for setting that up.

388
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,000
You really put yourself out there.

389
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,040
Glad I could help.

390
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,840
Rick and I set terms.

391
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,760
He's gonna consider them and then
we'll, uh, meet again in two days.

392
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,320
What sort of terms?

393
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,000
(LAUGHS)

394
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,520
Hope it works out.

395
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,120
So, I met this Governor.

396
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,080
Sat with him for quite a while.

397
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,880
MERLE: Just the two of you?

398
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,040
Yeah.

399
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,280
Should have gone
when we had the chance, bro.

400
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,160
He wants the prison.

401
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,200
He wants us gone.

402
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,760
Dead.

403
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,640
He wants us dead

404
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,200
for what we did to Woodbury.

405
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,440
We're going to war.

406
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,680
(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

407
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,320
HERSHEL: The group's taking it
as well as can be expected.

408
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Merle and Michonne are convinced
we should hit first.

409
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,720
Carol and I think
we should take our chances on the road.

410
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,800
We're in this together.

411
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,280
So if we stay and fight,

412
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,800
so be it.

413
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,080
RICK: He gave me a choice.

414
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,400
A way out.

415
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,320
What does he want?

416
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,600
Michonne.

417
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,880
He'll kill her.

418
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,480
And then kill us anyway.

419
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,560
But what if he doesn't?

420
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,240
What if this is the answer?

421
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,520
Why didn't you tell them?

422
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,400
They need

423
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,680
to be scared.

424
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,200
They are.

425
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,400
Good.

426
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,800
'Cause that's the only way
they'll accept it.

427
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,880
She saved my life.

428
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,600
And Carl's.

429
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,720
Glenn, Maggie.

430
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,040
If she hadn't come here,

431
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,200
we never would have known
they were taken.

432
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,040
She's earned her place.

433
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,200
Yeah.

434
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,600
Yeah, she has.

435
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,400
Are you willing to sacrifice
your daughters' lives for her?

436
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,440
Why are you telling me?

437
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,920
Because...

438
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm hoping you can talk me out of it.
