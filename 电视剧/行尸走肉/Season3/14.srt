Yeah.

Did you find her?

No luck.

384
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,040
Just got word.
Someone barbecued the pit biters.

385
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,360
Who?

386
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,840
Got a few shit-stirrers in the bunch.

387
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,760
-Tyreese and his sister.
-(SIGHS)

388
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,200
Send them over to distro.

389
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,360
-Rest of the group, too.
-All right.

390
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,480
We're gonna need biters, so get some more.

391
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,840
All right, you got it.

393
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,800
Sorry to keep you waiting.

394
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,960
Did you find her?

395
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,280
No.

396
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,160
Hardly made it back myself.

397
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,400
I'll look again tomorrow.

398
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,440
So I heard there was
a little hang-up at the pits.

399
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,440
You got a beef with Rick,
that's fair enough.

400
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,760
But you can't be feeding
his kids to biters.

401
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,720
No one's feeding anyone to biters.

402
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,200
Well, I saw the trailers.

403
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,840
No, it's a scare tactic. It's a bluff.

404
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,640
I'd rather scare his people
into leaving us alone

405
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,400
than engaging in another fight.

406
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,920
I'm trying to save lives here.

407
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,080
They're just for show?

408
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,280
You know, people are more
afraid of a biter on a leash

409
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,840
than a gun in their face.

410
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,400
It's pretty effective.

411
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,280
Then why didn't your man just say that?

412
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,400
'Cause...

413
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,720
We don't discuss tactics with people
that we don't really know.

Governor, look.

416
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,600
I shoot my mouth off sometimes,
but the truth is we want to stay.

417
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,360
I saw red. It won't happen again.

418
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,160
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

419
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,600
Where did you get the gasoline?

420
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,160
Come again?

421
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,840
Doesn't matter.

422
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,560
Is she dead?

423
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,160
I hope not.

424
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,440
Are you okay?

425
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,800
Never been better.

426
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,720
It's a real shame about the pits.

427
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,880
You heard about that, huh?

428
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,560
I hope you find out who did it.

429
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,560
Already have.
