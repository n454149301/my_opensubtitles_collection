When I met with the Governor,

413
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,520
he offered me a deal.

414
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,880
He said...

415
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,720
He said he would leave us alone

416
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,800
if I gave him Michonne.

417
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,680
And I was gonna do that...

418
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
To keep us safe.

419
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,160
I changed my mind.

420
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,040
But now Merle took Michonne
to fulfill the deal

421
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,960
and Daryl went to stop him,
and I don't know if it's too late.

422
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,360
I was wrong not to tell you.

423
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,320
And I'm sorry.

00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:41,400
What I said last year,
that first night after the farm,

425
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,200
it can't be like that.

426
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,400
It can't.

427
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:54,600
What we do, what we're willing to do,
who we are, it's not my call.

428
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,160
It can't be.

429
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,880
I couldn't sacrifice one of us
for the greater good

430
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,200
because, because we are the greater good.
